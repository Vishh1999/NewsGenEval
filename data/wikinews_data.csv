2025-04-20,Ryan Gosling cast in upcoming Star Wars film,https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Ryan_Gosling_cast_in_upcoming_Star_Wars_film,Entertainment,"On Friday morning, at Star Wars Celebration in Tokyo, Japan, Lucas film president Kathleen Kennedy and chief creative officer Dave Filoni announced an upcoming film in the Star Wars franchise titled Star Wars: Star fighter with Canadian actor Ryan Gosling being cast in a lead role. The film was set to be released in May of 2027. The film will be a standalone feature, and Gosling will be playing an original character. The film is said to be set five years after the events of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, though the plot does not involve the Skywalker family. No other details of the plot were revealed. Gosling is a longtime Star Wars fan, commenting that the films 'probably framed [his] idea of what a movie even was.'","['https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyq9d35ljro', 'https://variety.com/2025/film/news/ryan-gosling-star-wars-starfighter-may-2027-release-1236372307/']",ryan_gosling_vector_embedding_store,"[{'queries': ['Who is starring in the new Star Wars film?', 'Which actor was cast in Star Wars: Starfighter?', 'Ryan Gosling Star Wars movie casting?', 'Who is the lead actor in the upcoming Star Wars project?', 'Name the star of the new Star Wars film'], 'keywords': ['Ryan Gosling', 'Gosling to star', 'Gosling is to star', 'star will lead', 'Barbie actor Gosling', ""Gosling's lifelong passion""]}, {'queries': ['What is the title of the new Star Wars movie?', ""Name of Ryan Gosling's Star Wars film?"", 'What is the Star Wars movie called?', 'Title of upcoming Star Wars project?', 'Star Wars film name with Ryan Gosling?'], 'keywords': ['Star Wars: Starfighter', 'titled Star Wars: Starfighter', 'Starfighter', 'installment, titled Star Wars: Starfighter']}, {'queries': ['Who is directing the new Star Wars film?', 'Director of Star Wars: Starfighter?', ""Who will direct Ryan Gosling's Star Wars movie?"", 'Name the director of the upcoming Star Wars project?', 'Shawn Levy Star Wars director?'], 'keywords': ['Shawn Levy', 'directed by Deadpool & Wolverine director Shawn Levy', 'with Shawn Levy directing', 'Levy directing', 'filmmaker for this particular story than Shawn']}, {'queries': ['When will Star Wars: Starfighter be released?', 'Release date for Ryan Gosling Star Wars movie?', 'What year is the new Star Wars film coming out?', 'When does Star Wars: Starfighter hit theaters?', 'Release date May 2027 Star Wars?'], 'keywords': ['May 28, 2027', ""released in two years' time"", 'theatrical release date of May 28, 2027', 'comes to theaters on May 28, 2027']}, {'queries': ['Who wrote the screenplay for Star Wars: Starfighter?', 'Screenwriter for Ryan Gosling Star Wars film?', 'Who is the writer of the new Star Wars movie?', 'Script writer for Star Wars: Starfighter?', 'Jonathan Tropper Star Wars screenplay?'], 'keywords': ['Jonathan Tropper', 'Tropper has written the screenplay', 'written prior features for Levy', 'creator of the Apple TV+ series']}, {'queries': ['Where was the Star Wars film announced?', 'Star Wars Celebration Tokyo announcement?', ""Where did they reveal Ryan Gosling's casting?"", 'Location of Star Wars: Starfighter announcement?', 'Tokyo Star Wars event announcement?'], 'keywords': ['Star Wars Celebration in Tokyo', 'Tokyo', 'Star Wars Celebration event in Tokyo', 'livestreamed Star Wars Celebration', 'screaming audience']}, {'queries': ['When is the Star Wars film set in the timeline?', 'What time period does Star Wars: Starfighter take place?', 'Timeline placement of Ryan Gosling Star Wars movie?', 'When does the new Star Wars film occur chronologically?', 'Setting after Rise of Skywalker?'], 'keywords': ['five years after the events', 'after the events of Star Wars: Episode IX', 'The Rise of Skywalker', 'concluded the Skywalker saga', 'final feature chronologically']}, {'queries': ['What did Ryan Gosling say about the script?', ""Gosling's comments on Star Wars screenplay?"", 'Ryan Gosling quotes about the film?', 'What did Gosling think of the Star Wars story?', ""Gosling's reaction to the script quality?""], 'keywords': ['this script is just so good', 'great story with great and original characters', 'filled with so much heart and adventure', 'not a more perfect filmmaker']}, {'queries': [""What was shown about Gosling's childhood at the event?"", 'Ryan Gosling Star Wars bedsheets?', 'Childhood Star Wars connection for Gosling?', ""What did they display about Gosling's past?"", ""Evidence of Gosling's lifelong Star Wars fandom?""], 'keywords': ['childhood Star Wars bedsheets', 'lifelong passion for the franchise', 'dreaming about Star Wars before I even saw the film', 'framed my idea of what a movie even was']}, {'queries': ['What other Star Wars film is coming before Starfighter?', 'The Mandalorian movie release date?', ""Next Star Wars film before Gosling's movie?"", 'When does The Mandalorian & Grogu come out?', 'Star Wars films release schedule?'], 'keywords': ['The Mandalorian & Grogu', 'May 22, 2026', 'just over a year after', 'theatrical expansion of the Disney+ series', 'completed principal photography']}]","Ryan Gosling is to star in a new Star Wars film, which is set to be released in two years' time. The new Disney project is titled Star Wars: Starfighter, and will be directed by Deadpool & Wolverine director Shawn Levy.'The reality is that this script is just so good. It has such a great story with great and original characters,' said Barbie actor Gosling at a Star Wars Celebration in Tokyo.'It's filled with so much heart and adventure, and there just really is not a more perfect filmmaker for this particular story than Shawn.' Gosling's lifelong passion for the franchise was on display at the event, which showed his childhood Star Wars bedsheets on screen. 'You can see from the picture, I guess I was probably dreaming about Star Wars before I even saw the film,' he said. 'And it's probably framed my idea of what a movie even was,' he said. Ryan Gosling has the high ground. Lucasfilm confirmed that the star will lead a new 'Star Wars' installment, titled 'Star Wars: Starfighter,' with Shawn Levy directing. The film is eyeing a fall production start and Disney has set a theatrical release date of May 28, 2027. After numerous reports on Gosling and Levy's attachment to a 'Star Wars' project, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy and chief creative officer Dave Filoni officially unveiled plans for 'Starfighter' on Friday morning at the banner's annual Star Wars Celebration event in Tokyo. Variety can also confirm that Jonathan Tropper has written the screenplay for the film. Tropper has written prior features for Levy ('The Adam Project,' 'This Is Where I Leave You') and is the creator of the Apple TV+ series 'Your Friends & Neighbors.'Gosling and Levy appeared at the livestreamed Star Wars Celebration to further tease the project, with Gosling wearing a cap reading, 'Never tell me the odds.' 'Being here and seeing all of you [makes it] more inspiring to do it. There's so much creativity and imagination in this room and there's so much love. It's such a great reminder of how much movies can mean to us, specifically how much these movies mean to us,' Gosling told the screaming audience at the end of the presentation.'The force is a mysterious thing, but, as I'm here, the force is the fans. All we can hope for is, ‘May the fans be with us.'' 'We're fans too,' Levy said.'There's obviously a relationship between these stories and the audience, but we've spent our lives in that audience. We know how meaningful it is.'The standalone, which focuses on new characters in the 'Star Wars' universe, is set roughly five years after the events of 'Star Wars: Episode IX — The Rise of Skywalker,' which concluded the Skywalker saga and currently stands as the final feature chronologically on the 'Star Wars' timeline. No other casting details were announced. Star Wars: Starfighter comes to theaters on May 28, 2027. The project marks Levy's directorial follow-up to Marvel Studios' megasmash buddy comedy 'Deadpool & Wolverine,' which raked in $1.3 billion at the global box office after releasing in July 2024 and stands as the highest-grossing R-rated feature of all-time. Gosling was last seen in the action-heavy romcom 'The Fall Guy,' released in May 2024. 'Starfighter' is a new leap for the typically franchise-averse actor, whose few encounters with IP ('Barbie,' 'Blade Runner 2049') have had less of a track record with filmgoing audiences than the omnipresent (and superlatively lucrative) 'Star Wars' franchise.'Starfighter' will release just over a year after the next 'Star Wars' theatrical feature, 'The Mandalorian & Grogu.' That film, a theatrical expansion of the Disney+ series 'The Mandalorian,' has already completed principal photography and will release to theaters on May 22, 2026. It will mark the first 'Star Wars' feature since 'The Rise of Skywalker' debuted in December 2019.",129,Short,658,"[{'version': 'Human', 'Compression Ratio': 0.2031496063}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Compression Ratio': 0.242519685}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Compression Ratio': 0.25196850390000003}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Novel N-gram %': 41.2698412698}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Novel N-gram %': 32.0512820513}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Novel N-gram %': 24.0963855422}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Flesch Reading Ease': 60.4078488372, 'Flesch-Kincaid Grade': 10.1748449612, 'Gunning Fog': 12.9410852713, 'SMOG Index': 12.745084869}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Flesch Reading Ease': 66.0993915563, 'Flesch-Kincaid Grade': 8.728865894, 'Gunning Fog': 11.2586092715, 'SMOG Index': 10.9516}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Flesch Reading Ease': 63.1014082278, 'Flesch-Kincaid Grade': 9.3643987342, 'Gunning Fog': 12.2037974684, 'SMOG Index': 11.6982194122}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Distinct-1': 0.7974683544000001, 'Distinct-2': 0.9615384615}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Distinct-1': 0.8125, 'Distinct-2': 0.9473684211000001}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Distinct-1': 0.8383838384000001, 'Distinct-2': 0.9387755102}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'TP': 10, 'FP': 63, 'FN': 16, 'Keyword Precision': 0.1369863014, 'Keyword Recall': 0.3846153846, 'Keyword F1': 0.202020202, 'Keywords Found': 'celebration, feature, film, franchise, gosling, said, set, skywalker, star, wars', 'Keywords Missing': 'audience, characters, disney, fans, force, great, just, levy, mean, movies, new, project, release, shawn, starfighter, theatrical'}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'TP': 16, 'FP': 62, 'FN': 10, 'Keyword Precision': 0.20512820510000002, 'Keyword Recall': 0.6153846154, 'Keyword F1': 0.3076923077, 'Keywords Found': 'celebration, fans, film, force, franchise, gosling, levy, new, project, release, set, shawn, skywalker, star, starfighter, wars', 'Keywords Missing': 'audience, characters, disney, feature, great, just, mean, movies, said, theatrical'}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'TP': 14, 'FP': 74, 'FN': 12, 'Keyword Precision': 0.1590909091, 'Keyword Recall': 0.5384615385, 'Keyword F1': 0.24561403510000002, 'Keywords Found': 'celebration, characters, film, franchise, gosling, levy, new, project, set, shawn, skywalker, star, starfighter, wars', 'Keywords Missing': 'audience, disney, fans, feature, force, great, just, mean, movies, release, said, theatrical'}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Jaccard Similarity (vs Human)': 1.0}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Jaccard Similarity (vs Human)': 0.128}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Jaccard Similarity (vs Human)': 0.1774193548}]","[{'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'ROUGE-1 F1 (vs Human)': 0.47517730500000005, 'ROUGE-2 F1 (vs Human)': 0.2, 'ROUGE-L F1 (vs Human)': 0.27659574470000003}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'ROUGE-1 F1 (vs Human)': 0.5547945205, 'ROUGE-2 F1 (vs Human)': 0.2689655172, 'ROUGE-L F1 (vs Human)': 0.3219178082}]","[{'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'BERTScore P (vs Human)': 0.9623321295, 'BERTScore R (vs Human)': 0.9648821354, 'BERTScore F1 (vs Human)': 0.9636054635}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'BERTScore P (vs Human)': 0.9641134739, 'BERTScore R (vs Human)': 0.9688999057000001, 'BERTScore F1 (vs Human)': 0.9665007591}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Q2 Model Output': '1', 'Q2_score': 1}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Q2 Model Output': '1', 'Q2_score': 1}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Q2 Model Output': '1', 'Q2_score': 1}]","[{'Human_vs_Plain_winner': 'Plain LLM', 'Plain_vs_Human_winner': 'Human', 'Human_vs_RAG_winner': 'RAG LLM', 'RAG_vs_Human_winner': 'Human', 'RAG_vs_Plain_winner': 'Plain LLM', 'Plain_vs_RAG_winner': 'Plain LLM'}, {'Human_vs_Plain_confidence_score': 4, 'Plain_vs_Human_confidence_score': 4, 'Human_vs_RAG_confidence_score': 4, 'RAG_vs_Human_confidence_score': 4, 'RAG_vs_Plain_confidence_score': 4, 'Plain_vs_RAG_confidence_score': 4}, {'Human_vs_Plain_reasoning_text': 'Article 2 provides more detailed information about the plot, including the fact that the film is set five years after the events of Star Wars: Episode IX — The Rise of Skywalker and that it will be a standalone feature.

supportive' of his career. The British actor, best known for Willow and the Harry Potter films, was responsible for one of the awards show's most touching moments. The 2025 Baftas took place on Sunday evening (16 February) with Hollywood's brightest stars descending on London's Royal Festival Hall for the ceremony. Davis, 55, was awarded the Fellowship prize, known as Bafta's highest honour. Previous recipients include Maggie Smith, Mike Leigh, Samantha Morton, Martin Scorsese, and Sir Sidney Poitier. Davis was celebrated by Bafta for his career and role in creating a more inclusive industry. Accepting the award on stage, he joked: 'This is the best thing that's ever happened to me and I've been in Star Wars.' Becoming emotional, Davis admitted that 'life has been pretty tough' since the death of his wife Samantha last year. Praising his late wife for 'always supporting' his career and encouraging him to go for roles, Davis joked that her desire for him to take a job corresponded to how much she wanted to buy a new handbag. 'Thank you to the support of our wonderful children, I've been able to keep engaging in life,' he said, breaking down in tears. His children, Harrison and Annabelle, were seen in the crowd, with his daughter crying. Tom Felton, who starred opposite Davis in Harry Potter as Draco Malfoy, presented the award, giving a heart-felt speech about the impact the actor had on his life – revealing that he had been the one to teach his first spell at Hogwarts.'How talented, how hardworking, how loved this man is,' said Felton. In a video montage, George Lucas and Mark Hammil were among the stars to commend the actor on his award. Viewers at home were left wiping away tears at the emotional moment, with one person writing: 'I had no plans to cry today and yet here I am.' Another added: 'Love Warwick Davis, good speech.''Oh no, Warwick Davis got me crying,' said someone else, with a fourth person agreeing: 'Warwick Davis and his kids have me BAWLING.' Elsewhere during the ceremony, Conclave claimed the Best Film award at the Baftas having also bagged the award for Outstanding British Film, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Editing.

The winners at the Bafta Film Awards, celebrating the best in big screen action over the past 12 months, have been revealed. Conclave and The Brutalist won big, with four each; while Wicked, Emilia Perez, Anora, Dune: Part Two, A Real Pain and Wallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl won two each. Anora, about a New York stripper who has a whirlwind romance with the son of a Russian oligarch, had been picking up best picture momentum ahead of the Oscars next month - but instead came away with best actress and best casting. The best actress win for Madison was something of a surprise, despite her impressive performance in Sean Baker's film. Madison herself, on accepting the prize, said: 'Wow, I really wasn't expecting this. I probably should have listened to my publicist and written a speech or something!' The 25-year-old starred in US comedy series Better Things and also had roles in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and horror film Scream. But her leading role in Anora has catapulted her into the spotlight. Madison added: 'I want to take a moment to recognise the sex worker community. I see you, you deserve respect and human decency. I will always be an ally and a friend.'Demi Moore, who stars in body horror The Substance, has been picking up best actress prizes in the last couple of months, including at the Golden Globes and Critics Choice Awards. Many thought she would win the Bafta, too. She will still be a favourite at the Oscars although Madison's Bafta win does make things more interesting. The Substance only picked up one win on Sunday for make-up and hair. The film sees a TV aerobics presenter in her 50s (Moore) who takes a black-market drug to create a younger, more beautiful version of herself. Full of gory effects, the film is the favourite to pick up the same prize at next month's Oscars.",160,Short,1366,"[{'version': 'Human', 'Compression Ratio': 0.11282051280000001}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Compression Ratio': 0.1230769231}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Compression Ratio': 0.136996337}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Novel N-gram %': 34.2857142857}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Novel N-gram %': 17.9775280899}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Novel N-gram %': 17.1717171717}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Flesch Reading Ease': 45.5388304094, 'Flesch-Kincaid Grade': 11.103245614, 'Gunning Fog': 12.5450292398, 'SMOG Index': 12.4579756021}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Flesch Reading Ease': 49.9097619048, 'Flesch-Kincaid Grade': 10.9352380952, 'Gunning Fog': 13.419047619, 'SMOG Index': 13.0238667987}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Flesch Reading Ease': 48.9657299465, 'Flesch-Kincaid Grade': 11.0751925134, 'Gunning Fog': 13.6832085561, 'SMOG Index': 13.1874277437}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Distinct-1': 0.6930693069, 'Distinct-2': 0.92}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Distinct-1': 0.8317757009000001, 'Distinct-2': 0.9622641509000001}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Distinct-1': 0.792, 'Distinct-2': 0.9838709677}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'TP': 26, 'FP': 50, 'FN': 25, 'Keyword Precision': 0.3421052632, 'Keyword Recall': 0.5098039216, 'Keyword F1': 0.4094488189, 'Keywords Found': 'actor, actress, award, awards, bafta, best, brady, british, brutalist, conclave, corbet, davis, director, emilia, film, fowl, gromit, including, leading, madison, outstanding, role, supporting, vengeance, warwick, won', 'Keywords Missing': '2025, anora, big, blitz, complete, dune, kneecap, man, nosferatu, oscars, pain, perez, prize, real, said, sean, sing, stars, substance, unknown, wallace, wicked, win, winner, winners'}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'TP': 27, 'FP': 74, 'FN': 24, 'Keyword Precision': 0.2673267327, 'Keyword Recall': 0.5294117647000001, 'Keyword F1': 0.3552631579, 'Keywords Found': 'actor, actress, award, awards, bafta, best, big, brady, british, brutalist, conclave, corbet, davis, director, emilia, film, including, outstanding, pain, perez, prize, real, role, supporting, warwick, winners, won', 'Keywords Missing': '2025, anora, blitz, complete, dune, fowl, gromit, kneecap, leading, madison, man, nosferatu, oscars, said, sean, sing, stars, substance, unknown, vengeance, wallace, wicked, win, winner'}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'TP': 27, 'FP': 81, 'FN': 24, 'Keyword Precision': 0.25, 'Keyword Recall': 0.5294117647000001, 'Keyword F1': 0.3396226415, 'Keywords Found': 'actor, actress, anora, awards, bafta, best, big, brady, british, brutalist, conclave, corbet, davis, director, film, including, leading, madison, outstanding, prize, role, said, sean, warwick, win, winners, won', 'Keywords Missing': '2025, award, blitz, complete, dune, emilia, fowl, gromit, kneecap, man, nosferatu, oscars, pain, perez, real, sing, stars, substance, supporting, unknown, vengeance, wallace, wicked, winner'}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Jaccard Similarity (vs Human)': 1.0}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Jaccard Similarity (vs Human)': 0.2325581395}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Jaccard Similarity (vs Human)': 0.1901408451}]","[{'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'ROUGE-1 F1 (vs Human)': 0.5585585586, 'ROUGE-2 F1 (vs Human)': 0.1993957704, 'ROUGE-L F1 (vs Human)': 0.2642642643}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'ROUGE-1 F1 (vs Human)': 0.5325779037, 'ROUGE-2 F1 (vs Human)': 0.1652421652, 'ROUGE-L F1 (vs Human)': 0.3059490085}]","[{'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'BERTScore P (vs Human)': 0.9613888264, 'BERTScore R (vs Human)': 0.964494586, 'BERTScore F1 (vs Human)': 0.9629392028}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'BERTScore P (vs Human)': 0.9533866644000001, 'BERTScore R (vs Human)': 0.9612580538000001, 'BERTScore F1 (vs Human)': 0.9573062062000001}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Q2 Model Output': '1', 'Q2_score': 1}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Q2 Model Output': '1', 'Q2_score': 1}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Q2 Model Output': '1', 'Q2_score': 1}]","[{'Human_vs_Plain_winner': 'Plain LLM', 'Plain_vs_Human_winner': 'Human', 'Human_vs_RAG_winner': 'RAG LLM', 'RAG_vs_Human_winner': 'Human', 'RAG_vs_Plain_winner': 'Plain LLM', 'Plain_vs_RAG_winner': 'RAG LLM'}, {'Human_vs_Plain_confidence_score': 4, 'Plain_vs_Human_confidence_score': 4, 'Human_vs_RAG_confidence_score': 4, 'RAG_vs_Human_confidence_score': 4, 'RAG_vs_Plain_confidence_score': 4, 'Plain_vs_RAG_confidence_score': 4}, {'Human_vs_Plain_reasoning_text': 'Article 2 provides more accurate information about the ceremony, including the host, the award for Outstanding British Film, and the acceptance speech of Warwick Davis.

2025-05-16,Thai officials seize 238 tons of illegal e-waste at Bangkok port,https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Thai_officials_seize_238_tons_of_illegal_e-waste_at_Bangkok_port,Science & Environment,"In a press conference on Wednesday,Thai officials said local authorities had seized 238 tons of electronic waste hidden in ten storage containers falsely declared as metal scrap. According to Theeraj Athanavanich, director-general of the Customs Department, the containers were inspected the day before at the port of Bangkok, during a search that one source described as routine and another as random. He said the shipment was allegedly imported illegally from the United States. According to Dev discourse, it was one of the largest electronic waste (e-waste) imports Thai authorities have uncovered this year. The contents of the containers were declared to customs as 'mixed metal scrap,' but also contained electronic circuit boards, said Athanavanich. He said Thai officials planned to bring charges for falsely declaring imports and illegally bringing e-waste into the country. The authorities planned to refuse the containers and return them to their sender. According to AP News, citing a 2024 United Nations report, e-waste is piling up globally, with 62 million tons generated in 2022 and only 22% properly collected and recycled.","['https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/science-environment/3381601-thailand-cracks-down-on-illegal-e-waste-imports', 'https://apnews.com/article/thailand-illegal-import-electronic-waste-bangkok-port-994ef5e8c3776e9b77580d9954eebaeb']",ewaste_vector_embedding_store,"[{'queries': [""What was seized by Thai officials at Bangkok's port?"", 'How much illegal e-waste was confiscated?', 'What was the total weight of the seized contraband?', 'How many tons of electronic waste did Thai officials seize?', 'What was the scale of the illegal e-waste seizure?'], 'keywords': ['238 tons', 'illegally imported electronic waste', 'one of the largest seizures of its kind this year', 'port of Bangkok', ""Bangkok's port"", '238 tons of illegal e-waste']}, {'queries': ['Where did the illegal electronic waste originate from?', 'What was the country of origin of the seized e-waste?', 'Which country sent the illegal electronic waste?', 'Did the seized e-waste come from the United States?', 'The source of the illegal shipment to Thailand?'], 'keywords': ['from the United States', 'return the waste to its country of origin', 'return the waste to its origin', 'from the US']}, {'queries': ['How was the illegal shipment disguised?', 'What was the e-waste declared as on the customs documents?', 'What was the false declaration on the containers?', 'What did the 10 large containers supposedly contain?', 'What was the misleading label on the contraband?'], 'keywords': ['labeled as mixed metal scrap', 'declared as mixed metal scrap', 'contained circuit boards mixed with metal scrap', 'falsely declaring goods', 'falsely declaring imported goods', 'turned out to be circuit boards mixed in a huge pile of metal scrap']}, {'queries': ['What are the environmental and health dangers of e-waste?', 'What are the hazardous components found in electronic waste?', 'Why is e-waste dangerous to people and the environment?', 'What toxic materials are present in electronic waste?', 'What precious metals do recyclers extract from e-waste?'], 'keywords': ['environmental impacts that are dangerous to the people', 'health hazards', 'laden with lead and mercury, cadmium and other toxins', 'Recyclers are after gold, silver, palladium and copper', 'burn plastics to release encased copper', 'unsafe methods to extract precious metals']}, {'queries': ['What are the worldwide trends for electronic waste?', 'How much e-waste was generated globally in 2022?', 'What is the projection for global e-waste by 2030?', ""According to the UN report, what's happening with e-waste?"", 'What percentage of e-waste was properly recycled in 2022?'], 'keywords': ['globally escalating electronic waste', '62 million tons amassed in 2022', 'projected to escalate to 82 million tons by 2030', 'only 22% of the waste was properly collected and recycled in 2022', 'quantity is expected to fall to 20% by the end of the decade', 'higher consumption, limited repair options, shorter product life cycles, and inadequate management infrastructure']}, {'queries': ['What actions will Thai authorities take regarding the illegal e-waste?', 'What charges are being pressed against those responsible?', 'What is the plan for the seized waste?', 'Are there any factories suspected to be involved?', 'What is the punishment for illegally importing e-waste?'], 'keywords': ['press charges for falsely declaring goods and illegally importing e-waste', 'plans to return the waste to its origin', 'suspicion and investigation into factories in Samut Sakhon', 'at least two factories in Samut Sakhon province', 'ban on the import of a range of electronic waste products in 2020', 'Cabinet in February approved an expanded list of the banned waste']}]","Thai officials announced on Wednesday the seizure of 238 tons of illegally imported electronic waste from the United States at Bangkok's port. This marks one of the largest seizures of its kind this year, highlighting a significant environmental threat. The contraband, transported in 10 large containers, was labeled as mixed metal scrap but actually contained circuit boards mixed with metal scrap, Theeraj Athanavanich, director-general of the Customs Department, reported. The discovery came during a routine container inspection. A recent UN report points to globally escalating electronic waste, with 62 million tons amassed in 2022, projected to escalate to 82 million tons by 2030. Theeraj stated that Thai authorities aim to press charges for falsely declaring goods and illegally importing e-waste, with plans to return the waste to its origin. Furthermore, there is suspicion and investigation into factories in Samut Sakhon, potentially linked to the illicit imports. Thai officials said Wednesday they seized 238 tons of illegally imported electronic waste from the United States at the port of Bangkok, one of the biggest lots they've found this year. The waste, which came in 10 large containers, was declared as mixed metal scrap but turned out to be circuit boards mixed in a huge pile of metal scrap, said Theeraj Athanavanich, director-general of the Customs Department. It was found Tuesday in a random inspection. A U. N. report last year said electronic waste is piling up worldwide. Some 62 million tons of electronic waste was generated in 2022 and that figure is on track to reach 82 million tons by 2030, the report said. It said only 22% of the waste was properly collected and recycled in 2022 and that quantity is expected to fall to 20% by the end of the decade due to higher consumption, limited repair options, shorter product life cycles, and inadequate management infrastructure. Theeraj said Thai authorities are looking to press charges including falsely declaring imported goods, illegally importing electronic waste and planning to return the waste to its country of origin.'It's important that we take action on this kind of goods,' he said. 'There are environmental impacts that are dangerous to the people, especially communities around factories that might import these things for processing, then recycling.'Electronic waste creates huge health hazards. Many components are laden with lead and mercury, cadmium and other toxins. Recyclers are after gold, silver, palladium and copper, mainly from printed circuit boards, but lax controls mean that facilities often burn plastics to release encased copper and use unsafe methods to extract precious metals. Thailand passed a ban on the import of a range of electronic waste products in 2020. The Cabinet in February approved an expanded list of the banned waste. Sunthron Kewsawang, deputy director-general of the Department of Industrial Works, said officials suspected at least two factories in Samut Sakhon province, which borders Bangkok, are involved in importing the waste.

2025-07-10,20-year-old astrophotographer captures rare solar eclipse on Saturn,https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/20-year-old_astrophotographer_captures_rare_solar_eclipse_on_Saturn,Science & Environment,"A 20-year-old astrophotographer from Shoreline, Washington has photographed a rare solar eclipse on Saturn from his hometown, an event that will not be seen again until 2038. The photographer, Adam Smadi, planned the image days ahead and took the image on June 1, using the Stellarium softwareto pinpoint when Saturn's largest moon, Titan, would cast a shadow across the planet's surface. Smadi set up his 9.25-inch telescope at about 1a.m. PDT (08:00UTC) so the optics could cool to the outdoor temperature. This step helps prevent air currents inside the telescope tube that can blur images. By 3:30a.m. PDT (10:30UTC), Saturn was high enough above the horizon to begin taking photos. He used a ZWO ASI662MC astrophotography camera with an infrared filter. He took continuous video clips, then used software to sort and combine thousands of sharp frames into a single image. The result shows Titan's small dark shadow crossing Saturn's pale surface. In the same view, three other moons, Dione, Tethys, and Enceladus, appear as tiny dots near the rings. Adam Smadi initially shared the photos on his Instagram. Some viewers from forums and social media praised the image for its clarity and the effort behind it.","['https://www.wondersinspace.com/astrophotographer-captures-a-rare-solar-eclipse-on-saturn/', 'https://petapixel.com/2025/06/25/this-photographer-captured-a-solar-eclipse-on-saturn/']",saturn_vector_embedding_store,"[{'queries': ['What did Adam Smadi capture a photo of?', 'What event was photographed on Saturn?', 'Describe the rare event captured by an astrophotographer.', ""What is a 'shadow transit'?"", 'What is a solar eclipse on Saturn?'], 'keywords': ['rare solar eclipse on Saturn', 'shadow transit', 'Saturn’s largest moon, Titan, casting a small dark shadow on the planet’s surface', ""Titan's shadow on the surface of the planet""]}, {'queries': ['How old is the astrophotographer who captured the eclipse?', 'What is the name of the astrophotographer?', 'Where is Adam Smadi from?', ""What is Adam Smadi's hobby?"", 'How long has Smadi been doing astrophotography?'], 'keywords': ['20-year-old astrophotographer', 'Adam Smadi', 'from Shoreline, Washington', 'practicing astrophotography for about two years']}, {'queries': ['What equipment did Adam Smadi use to capture the image?', 'What kind of telescope did Smadi use?', 'Which camera was used to photograph the eclipse on Saturn?', 'What filter did the astrophotographer use?', 'What software did Smadi use for planning the shot?'], 'keywords': ['9.25 inch telescope', 'ZWO ASI662MC camera', 'infrared filter (685 nm)', 'Stellarium software']}, {'queries': ['How often do these solar eclipses on Saturn occur?', 'How rare is this type of celestial event?', 'When will the solar eclipse on Saturn be visible again?', 'How long do the viewing windows for these eclipses last?', ""When do Saturn's rings have to be for a shadow transit to be visible?""], 'keywords': ['not be visible again until 2038', 'rare', 'happen when Saturn’s rings are edge-on from Earth’s point of view', 'viewing windows last only a few months', 'return about every 15 years', '13 years']}, {'queries': ['What other moons of Saturn were captured in the image?', 'Besides Titan, which other Saturnian moons did Smadi photograph?', 'How many moons does Saturn have in total?', 'Did Smadi photograph the Cassini division?', 'What is the Cassini division?'], 'keywords': ['Titan', 'Rhea, Dione, Tethys, and Enceladus', '145 moons confirmed, the most of any planet in the solar system', 'Cassini division is a prominent gap that separates Saturn’s A and B rings']}, {'queries': [""How was the astrophotographer's photo received?"", 'What was the public reaction to the eclipse photo?', ""How was Smadi's work praised?"", 'Where did Adam Smadi share his photos?', 'What did people say about the photo?'], 'keywords': ['widely shared across astronomy forums and social media platforms', 'drawing praise from viewers around the world', 'Award winning', 'Fantastic, glad you were able to catch it!', 'Galileo would lose his mind over this shot']}]","A 20-year-old astrophotographer from Shoreline, Washington, has captured a rare solar eclipse on Saturn. The event, known as a shadow transit, showed Saturn's largest moon, Titan, casting a small dark shadow on the planet's surface. This type of eclipse will not be visible again until 2038. Adam Smadi has been practicing astrophotography for about two years. He said that he planned the shot days in advance using the Stellarium software, which helped him find the exact time and location from which the eclipse would be visible. 'I saw that it was going to be visible during the perfect time from Shoreline,' Smadi told Wonders in Space.'I knew I had to try.' He began setting up his 9.25 inch telescope around 1 a.m. to let the equipment cool down and match the outdoor temperature and reduce air currents inside the telescope, helping create sharper images. By 3:30 a.m., Saturn was high enough in the sky to begin imaging. Smadi used a ZWO ASI662MC camera and an infrared filter (685 nm) that helped reveal more detail in Saturn's atmosphere.'I stacked thousands of images using video captures,' he told Wonders in Space. 'And there's the result.'Shadow transits like this are rare. They only happen when Saturn's rings are edge-on from Earth's point of view, allowing moon shadows to cross the planet's face. These viewing windows last only a few months and return about every 15 years. Smadi's stunning photos have been widely shared across astronomy forums and social media platforms, drawing praise from viewers around the world. On Instagram, his followers and viewers flooded the comments with admiration and excitement. 'Award winning,' one user wrote.'Fantastic, glad you were able to catch it!' said another. While it may look like a small dot on a giant planet, it reflects hours of preparation and a precise understanding of planetary motion. An astrophotographer has been capturing spectacular images of solar eclipses taking place on Saturn — capturing Titan's shadow on the surface of the planet. Saturn, one of the solar system's gas giants, is being eclipsed, or transited, by its largest moon Titan several times over the coming months. After this busy period, there will not be another eclipse for 13 years. Titan is an intriguing moon that is larger than the planet Mercury and could potentially harbor life. It has a dense atmosphere, mostly made of nitrogen, and has liquid methane and ethane on its surface — the only other place in the solar system that is known to have stable liquid on the surface.'I got up at 3 A. M. to capture a solar eclipse on Saturn by its largest moon, Titan. These happen for a few months followed by a 15-year gap,' explains AJ Smadi in a Reddit post. However, Titan wasn't the only one of Saturn's moons Smadi captured, also capturing Rhea, Dione, Tethys, and Enceladus in his images. Saturn has a whopping 145 moons confirmed, the most of any planet in the solar system.'Many moons can be seen in the image as well,' Smadi writes on Instagram. 'And the Cassini division is now quite noticeable thanks to the near-perfect conditions during the morning twilight hours.'The Cassini division is a prominent gap that separates Saturn's A and B rings. 'Galileo would lose his mind over this shot. Well done!' writes one Redditor. Smadi is an amateur astrophotographer who took the image of Saturn on a backyard telescope. He has previously captured a solar eclipse on Jupiter as well. Smadi called the photo a 'bucket list shot of mine' adding that 'every 15 years, there's a brief few months when Saturn's largest moon Titan casts its shadow over Saturn every orbit. This is one of those years.'",210,Short,643,"[{'version': 'Human', 'Compression Ratio': 0.3208469055}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Compression Ratio': 0.3403908795}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Compression Ratio': 0.3729641694}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Novel N-gram %': 47.8260869565}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Novel N-gram %': 8.0}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Novel N-gram %': 11.6071428571}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Flesch Reading Ease': 59.1858258493, 'Flesch-Kincaid Grade': 8.7687309645, 'Gunning Fog': 10.1224521671, 'SMOG Index': 10.2148896797}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Flesch Reading Ease': 58.5571144645, 'Flesch-Kincaid Grade': 9.0857416268, 'Gunning Fog': 10.8326831064, 'SMOG Index': 10.7277628885}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Flesch Reading Ease': 56.1973684211, 'Flesch-Kincaid Grade': 10.1410526316, 'Gunning Fog': 11.8105263158, 'SMOG Index': 11.2081432602}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Distinct-1': 0.9055118110000001, 'Distinct-2': 1.0}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Distinct-1': 0.9328358209000001, 'Distinct-2': 1.0}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Distinct-1': 0.8484848485, 'Distinct-2': 1.0}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'TP': 15, 'FP': 117, 'FN': 13, 'Keyword Precision': 0.1136363636, 'Keyword Recall': 0.5357142857, 'Keyword F1': 0.1875, 'Keywords Found': 'astrophotographer, eclipse, image, images, largest, moon, moons, planet, saturn, shadow, smadi, solar, surface, telescope, titan', 'Keywords Missing': 'captured, capturing, gap, happen, helped, hours, known, liquid, months, place, shot, visible, years'}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'TP': 20, 'FP': 116, 'FN': 8, 'Keyword Precision': 0.14705882350000002, 'Keyword Recall': 0.7142857143, 'Keyword F1': 0.24390243900000003, 'Keywords Found': 'astrophotographer, captured, eclipse, happen, helped, images, known, largest, moon, planet, saturn, shadow, shot, smadi, solar, surface, telescope, titan, visible, years', 'Keywords Missing': 'capturing, gap, hours, image, liquid, months, moons, place'}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'TP': 22, 'FP': 105, 'FN': 6, 'Keyword Precision': 0.17322834650000002, 'Keyword Recall': 0.7857142857, 'Keyword F1': 0.28387096770000003, 'Keywords Found': 'astrophotographer, captured, eclipse, gap, helped, images, known, largest, liquid, moon, moons, place, planet, saturn, shadow, shot, smadi, solar, surface, titan, visible, years', 'Keywords Missing': 'capturing, happen, hours, image, months, telescope'}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Jaccard Similarity (vs Human)': 1.0}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Jaccard Similarity (vs Human)': 0.2698412698}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Jaccard Similarity (vs Human)': 0.16410256410000001}]","[{'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'ROUGE-1 F1 (vs Human)': 0.6267281106, 'ROUGE-2 F1 (vs Human)': 0.287037037, 'ROUGE-L F1 (vs Human)': 0.3732718894}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'ROUGE-1 F1 (vs Human)': 0.4774774775, 'ROUGE-2 F1 (vs Human)': 0.16742081450000001, 'ROUGE-L F1 (vs Human)': 0.2342342342}]","[{'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'BERTScore P (vs Human)': 0.9684437513, 'BERTScore R (vs Human)': 0.9693627357000001, 'BERTScore F1 (vs Human)': 0.9689030051}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'BERTScore P (vs Human)': 0.9590541720000001, 'BERTScore R (vs Human)': 0.9582841396, 'BERTScore F1 (vs Human)': 0.9586689472000001}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Q2 Model Output': '1', 'Q2_score': 1}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Q2 Model Output': '1', 'Q2_score': 1}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Q2 Model Output': '1', 'Q2_score': 1}]","[{'Human_vs_Plain_winner': 'Human', 'Plain_vs_Human_winner': 'Plain LLM', 'Human_vs_RAG_winner': 'Human', 'RAG_vs_Human_winner': 'RAG LLM', 'RAG_vs_Plain_winner': 'Plain LLM', 'Plain_vs_RAG_winner': 'Plain LLM'}, {'Human_vs_Plain_confidence_score': 4, 'Plain_vs_Human_confidence_score': 4, 'Human_vs_RAG_confidence_score': 4, 'RAG_vs_Human_confidence_score': 4, 'RAG_vs_Plain_confidence_score': 4, 'Plain_vs_RAG_confidence_score': 4}, {'Human_vs_Plain_reasoning_text': ""Article 1 provides more detailed information about the equipment used, such as the specific camera model (ZWO ASI662MC) and the infrared filter (685 nm), which helps to reveal more detail in Saturn's atmosphere.

The event, which will not be visible again until 2038, has been widely shared across astronomy forums and social media platforms, drawing praise from viewers around the world. Adam Smadi, who has been practicing astrophotography for about two years, planned the shot days in advance using the Stellarium software, which helped him find the exact time and location from which the eclipse would be visible. He began setting up his 9.25-inch telescope around 1 a.m. to let the equipment cool down and match the outdoor temperature and reduce air currents inside the telescope, helping create sharper images. By 3:30 a.m., Saturn was high enough in the sky to begin imaging. Smadi used a ZWO ASI662MC camera and an infrared filter (685 nm) that helped reveal more detail in Saturn's atmosphere. ""I stacked thousands of images using video captures,"" he told Wonders in Space. ""And there's the result."" Shadow transits like this are rare. They only happen when Saturn's rings are edge-on from Earth's point of view, allowing moon shadows to cross the planet's face.","A 20-year-old amateur astrophotographer from Shoreline, Washington, has captured a rare solar eclipse on Saturn, showing Saturn's largest moon, Titan, casting a small dark shadow on the planet's surface.

Adam Smadi, who has been practicing astrophotography for about two years, planned the shot days in advance using the Stellarium software, which helped him find the exact time and location from which the eclipse would be visible. ""I saw that it was going to be visible during the perfect time from Shoreline,"" Smadi told Wonders in Space. ""I knew I had to try."" Smadi captured not only Titan but also other moons of Saturn, including Rhea, Dione, Tethys, and Enceladus, in his images. Saturn has a whopping 145 moons confirmed, the most of any planet in the solar system. The Cassini division, a prominent gap that separates Saturn's A and B rings, is also visible in Smadi's stunning photos. ""Galileo would lose his mind over this shot. Well done!"" writes one Redditor. Titan is an intriguing moon that is larger than the planet Mercury and could potentially harbor life. It has a dense atmosphere, mostly made of nitrogen, and has liquid methane and ethane on its surface — the only other place in the solar system that is known to have stable liquid on the surface."
2023-08-13,US: Tulsa residents approve $814 million infrastructure package,https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/US%3A_Tulsa_residents_approve_%24814_million_infrastructure_package,Politics & Policy,"On Tuesday, voters in Tulsa, Oklahoma,US approved an US $814 million package to improve the infrastructure around the city. The 'Improve our Tulsa 3' package received more than the requirement of 60% of the ballots cast.Tulsa MayorG.T. Bynum had campaigned for the approval of the measure, stating, 'We have allowed facilities across the city to fall behind when it comes to maintenance. Earlier this year, my colleagues on the council and I went on a tour of really critical city facilities. What we saw — and I say this as somebody who loves Tulsa — it was embarrassing.'Tulsa City Councilor Grant Miller cautioned against approving the measure, objecting that the city council wasn't given a appropriate timeframe to review the proposed projects.The measure would keep the city's sales tax at its current 3.65 percent, but would divert some revenue towards the improvements proposed to be funded by the issuance of $42 million of additional bonds and by preexisting bonds.The measure's funding would include $95 million for housing projects, $93.8 million for street projects that had been approved previously, $46 million for projects to widen streets, $58.5 million for improvements to the fire department's vehicles, $47.5 million for a facility to house police and space for municipal courts, and $79.7 million for upgrades to Tulsa's Performing Arts Center.","['https://www.kosu.org/oklahoma-election-results-august-2023?eType=EmailBlastContent&eId=df3104f2-75ec-4eb1-a1f4-832d85ba6aa0', 'https://www.publicradiotulsa.org/local-regional/2023-08-08/capital-improvement-package-improve-our-tulsa-passes']",tulsa_residents_vector_embedding_store,"[{'queries': [""What was the total value of Tulsa's infrastructure package?"", 'How much money did Tulsa voters approve for improvements?', ""What's the dollar amount of the Improve Our Tulsa package?"", 'How much will Tulsa spend on infrastructure improvements?', ""Total cost of Tulsa's bond propositions?""], 'keywords': ['$814 million', '814 million', 'hundreds of millions of dollars', 'Improve Our Tulsa package', 'infrastructure improvement package']}, {'queries': ['What percentage of Tulsa voters supported the package?', 'How did the Tulsa infrastructure vote turn out?', ""What was the margin of victory for Tulsa's propositions?"", 'Did Tulsa voters approve the bond measures?', 'What were the voting results in Tulsa?'], 'keywords': ['more than 60%', 'over 60% of the vote', 'overwhelmingly', 'thumbs up', 'All three bond propositions', 'were passed']}, {'queries': ['How will Tulsa pay for the infrastructure improvements?', ""What tax increase will fund Tulsa's projects?"", 'How much will sales tax go up in Tulsa?', ""What's the tax impact of Tulsa's infrastructure package?"", 'Will Tulsa residents pay higher taxes?'], 'keywords': ['0.95 cents', 'raise sales taxes', 'existing 0.95%', '3.65% sales tax', 'property and sales taxes in Tulsa County will remain the same']}, {'queries': [""What projects are included in Tulsa's package?"", 'How will Tulsa spend the $814 million?', 'What infrastructure will be improved in Tulsa?', ""Details of Tulsa's improvement projects?"", ""Breakdown of Tulsa's infrastructure spending?""], 'keywords': ['$93.8 million for inflation-adjusted costs for previously-approved street projects', '$46 million for street widening', '$79.7 million for Performing Arts Center upgrades', '$47.5 million for a new public safety center', '$58.5 million to upgrade the fire department vehicle fleet', '$95 million for housing initiatives']}, {'queries': ['Who is the mayor of Tulsa?', 'Which Tulsa mayor supported the infrastructure package?', 'Who urged Tulsa voters to approve the measures?', ""Name of Tulsa's current mayor?"", 'Which official promoted the Tulsa infrastructure vote?'], 'keywords': ['Mayor G.

These August elections — with relatively low voter turnout — determine the fate of hundreds of millions of dollars in local projects across the state. Tulsa voters overwhelmingly gave an $814 million infrastructure improvement package a thumbs up. Their vote will raise sales taxes in the city by 0.95 cents. Unofficial results show more than 60% voted in favor of the ballot measures. Mayor G. T. Bynum had urged Tulsa voters to approve the package.'We have allowed facilities across the city to fall behind when it comes to maintenance. Earlier this year, my colleagues on the council and I went on a tour of really critical city facilities. What we saw — and I say this as somebody who loves Tulsa — it was embarrassing,' Bynum said leading up to the vote. The projects that will be funded include: $93.8 million for inflation-adjusted costs for previously-approved street projects, $46 million for street widening, $79.7 million for Performing Arts Center upgrades including ADA compliance, Chapman Hall renovation and facilities updates, $47.5 million for a new public safety center to include police headquarters and municipal court space, $58.5 million to upgrade the fire department vehicle fleet and $95 million for housing initiatives. Chickasha residents voted to bump up a local sales tax by half a cent to pay for a new water treatment plant. The Chickasha Municipal Authority provides about 16,000 people in central Oklahoma with drinking water. They overwhelmingly voted to fund a new water treatment plant — about 94% of voters were for the proposition. If the sales tax measured had failed, the city said it would hike water rates by 82%. The current plant, which was completed in the 1970s, is operating under consent orders from the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality — special arrangements that allow the system to keep its permits while it works to fix violations. The city says its water treatment plant is 'operating past its useful life and is at risk of catastrophic failure.'It lies in a FEMA-designated special flood hazard area between the Washita River and Line Creek. But a new plant will cost $74 million, by the city's estimates. The city will cover part of that with the 1.25 cent sales tax voters approved on Tuesday. The current 0.75 cent sales tax is expiring, so Chickasha shoppers will experience an increase of a half a cent for every dollar spent. Almost 90% of voters approved a pair of school bonds to pay for a handful of infrastructure projects and new buses to the tune of $3.2 million The rural public school district in Garfield County — 15 miles southwest of Enid — will get cafeteria improvements, air conditioning in a gym and a health and wellness center for community fitness. More than two-thirds of voters cast their ballots to approve two propositions. The first proposition renews the Public Service Company of Oklahoma's existing franchise 'which grants them the non-exclusive right to serve Catoosa customers for twenty-five years for a percentage fee to be paid back to the city,' according to the city. That fee will increase 1%, which will be used to pay for public safety services. The second increases the lodging tax in Catoosa from 5% to 8%. The money from the increase is earmarked for public safety. A local sales tax that funds road and trail improvements in the city will continue. More than 70% of Owasso voters approved it. The city intends to use the funds for improvements at several intersections, widening some roads and on the Ranch Creek Trail project, linking together various parts of the trail system in Owasso. On Tuesday Tulsa residents cast their votes in favor of hundreds of millions of dollars for capital improvements and maintenance in the city. All three bond propositions on the ballot and an extension of a temporary sales tax were passed with over 60% of the vote. More than 28,000 Tulsans voted in the election. If passed, Improve Our Tulsa 3 would put roughly $814 million toward everything from a first-time housing initiative to street widening and even maintenance at the Tulsa Zoo. Public Radio Tulsa has compiled a fact sheet on the package. What's in the package? The proposed Improve Our Tulsa package includes: $93.8 million for inflation-adjusted costs for previously-approved street projects, $46 million for street widening, $79.7 million for Performing Arts Center upgrades including ADA compliance, Chapman Hall renovation and facilities updates, $47.5 million for a new public safety center to include police headquarters and municipal court space, $58.5 million to upgrade the fire department vehicle fleet and $95 million for housing initiatives. Will taxes go up? If passed, property and sales taxes in Tulsa County will remain the same. The city will use an existing 0.95% of its 3.65% sales tax for the improvement package. Projects in Improve Our Tulsa 3 will be funded by the sales taxes and mostly-preexisting bonds financed by property taxes. One bond of $42 million was added to the package to address additional requests following citizen feedback at town halls. What do city officials think about the package? Other than City Councilor Grant Miller — who has raised concerns that council wasn't given enough time to review the projects — all councilors support the package. Councilor Christian Bengel has argued there's 'a lot that goes into' the projects, and that residents' tax dollars would be well-spent. On Monday, four former Tulsa mayors joined Mayor G. T. Bynum in their support of the package. Former mayor Dewey Bartlett spoke highly of the citizens' sales tax overview committee, which is tasked with examining how the money is spent in the projects.",231,Short,988,"[{'version': 'Human', 'Compression Ratio': 0.2251037344}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Compression Ratio': 0.2582987552}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Compression Ratio': 0.1763485477}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Novel N-gram %': 39.8230088496}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Novel N-gram %': 14.0625}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Novel N-gram %': 15.625}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Flesch Reading Ease': 49.1796243292, 'Flesch-Kincaid Grade': 10.508372093, 'Gunning Fog': 12.0107334526, 'SMOG Index': 11.8073845699}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Flesch Reading Ease': 49.3257590361, 'Flesch-Kincaid Grade': 10.5032771084, 'Gunning Fog': 11.780562249, 'SMOG Index': 11.8554640768}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Flesch Reading Ease': 47.6405392157, 'Flesch-Kincaid Grade': 10.1338235294, 'Gunning Fog': 10.8431372549, 'SMOG Index': 11.2081432602}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Distinct-1': 0.8432835821, 'Distinct-2': 1.0}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Distinct-1': 0.7901234568000001, 'Distinct-2': 0.9813664596}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Distinct-1': 0.8205128205000001, 'Distinct-2': 0.9827586207000001}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'TP': 16, 'FP': 93, 'FN': 19, 'Keyword Precision': 0.14678899080000002, 'Keyword Recall': 0.4571428571, 'Keyword F1': 0.2222222222, 'Keywords Found': 'approved, center, city, facilities, improvements, maintenance, million, municipal, oklahoma, package, projects, sales, street, tax, tulsa, voters', 'Keywords Missing': 'cent, chickasha, local, mayor, new, passed, pay, plant, propositions, public, residents, safety, school, spent, taxes, trail, voted, water, widening'}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'TP': 31, 'FP': 87, 'FN': 4, 'Keyword Precision': 0.2627118644, 'Keyword Recall': 0.8857142857, 'Keyword F1': 0.40522875820000004, 'Keywords Found': 'approved, cent, center, chickasha, city, facilities, improvements, local, maintenance, mayor, million, new, oklahoma, package, pay, plant, projects, propositions, public, residents, safety, sales, school, street, tax, taxes, tulsa, voted, voters, water, widening', 'Keywords Missing': 'municipal, passed, spent, trail'}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'TP': 20, 'FP': 74, 'FN': 15, 'Keyword Precision': 0.2127659574, 'Keyword Recall': 0.5714285714, 'Keyword F1': 0.3100775194, 'Keywords Found': 'approved, center, city, facilities, mayor, million, new, oklahoma, package, projects, public, residents, safety, sales, street, taxes, tulsa, voted, voters, widening', 'Keywords Missing': 'cent, chickasha, improvements, local, maintenance, municipal, passed, pay, plant, propositions, school, spent, tax, trail, water'}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Jaccard Similarity (vs Human)': 1.0}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Jaccard Similarity (vs Human)': 0.1586538462}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Jaccard Similarity (vs Human)': 0.20114942530000002}]","[{'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'ROUGE-1 F1 (vs Human)': 0.5121951220000001, 'ROUGE-2 F1 (vs Human)': 0.1591836735, 'ROUGE-L F1 (vs Human)': 0.19105691060000002}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'ROUGE-1 F1 (vs Human)': 0.5742092457, 'ROUGE-2 F1 (vs Human)': 0.24449877750000001, 'ROUGE-L F1 (vs Human)': 0.21411192210000002}]","[{'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'BERTScore P (vs Human)': 0.9631955028, 'BERTScore R (vs Human)': 0.9601957202, 'BERTScore F1 (vs Human)': 0.9616932869}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'BERTScore P (vs Human)': 0.9694612026, 'BERTScore R (vs Human)': 0.9631775022, 'BERTScore F1 (vs Human)': 0.9663091302000001}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Q2 Model Output': '1', 'Q2_score': 1}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Q2 Model Output': '1', 'Q2_score': 1}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Q2 Model Output': '1', 'Q2_score': 1}]","[{'Human_vs_Plain_winner': 'Human', 'Plain_vs_Human_winner': 'Plain LLM', 'Human_vs_RAG_winner': 'Human', 'RAG_vs_Human_winner': 'RAG LLM', 'RAG_vs_Plain_winner': 'RAG LLM', 'Plain_vs_RAG_winner': 'Plain LLM'}, {'Human_vs_Plain_confidence_score': 4, 'Plain_vs_Human_confidence_score': 4, 'Human_vs_RAG_confidence_score': 4, 'RAG_vs_Human_confidence_score': 4, 'RAG_vs_Plain_confidence_score': 4, 'Plain_vs_RAG_confidence_score': 4}, {'Human_vs_Plain_reasoning_text': ""Article 1 provides more detailed information about the projects that will be funded by the $814 million infrastructure improvement package, including $95 million for housing projects, $93.8 million for street projects, $46 million for street widening, $58.5 million for improvements to the fire department's vehicles, $47.5 million for a facility to house police and space for municipal courts, and $79.7 million for upgrades to Tulsa's Performing Arts Center.

A $42 million bond was added to the package to address additional requests following citizen feedback at town halls. Unofficial results show more than 60% voted in favor of the ballot measures. If the package had failed, property and sales taxes in Tulsa County would have remained the same. "
2025-04-23,Researchers film colossal squid in its natural habitat for the first time,https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Researchers_film_colossal_squid_in_its_natural_habitat_for_the_first_time,Science & Environment,"On Wednesday, April 16, the University of Essex,England, reported that researchers had, for the first time, recorded footage of a colossal squid, a member of the glass squid family (Cranchiidae), living in the deep sea. The sighting of the 30-centimeter juvenile squid took place on March 9 near the uninhabited South Sandwich Islands, part of a British Overseas Territory in the South Atlantic Ocean. Researchers obtained the footage roughly 600 meters beneath the ocean's surface.The sighting marked 100 years since the colossal squid was formally recognized and named. The remotely operated vehicle called'SuBastian'that captured the photographs and video was launched from the Schmidt Ocean Institute's research vehicle Falkor (too). It was part of a 35-day Ocean Census flagship expedition searching for new marine life. According to the Schmidt Ocean Institute, the 35-day voyage aboard the R/V Falkor (too) was part of an international effort to discover new marine species. The expedition brought together researchers from several institutions and initiatives, including the Ocean Census project and Go South, with Dr Michelle Taylor from the University of Essex leading the scientific team. Dr Taylor said, 'It's incredible that we can leverage the power of the taxonomic community through Falkor (too) telepresence while we are out at sea.'Deep-sea biologist Kat Bolstad of Auckland University of Technology, who did not take part in the expedition, helped identify the species shown in the footage.

In short: A deep-sea camera has captured footage of an elusive colossal squid, a 30-centimetre juvenile, in its natural habitat deep in the ocean for the first time. Past footage and specimens have only been caught on camera or a fishing line at the surface while dead or dying. What's next? Scientists hope to one day capture footage of a fully grown colossal squid to observe its behaviour. The world's heaviest squid has been caught on video in its natural deep ocean habitat for the first time. Well, a tiny 'teenage' specimen of the colossal squid (Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni) that measured 30 centimetres-long. But one day the delicate cephalopod could weigh as much as half a tonne and grow more than 7 metres long. Despite being first described 100 years ago, we know very little about the life cycle and behaviour of colossal squid, which are only found in waters surrounding Antarctica. Adult and juvenile specimens have been collected before but the mysterious creature has not been observed before at depth. The new footage was captured in March by the Schmidt Ocean Institute, a not-for-profit research group, during a voyage near South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. The juvenile was spotted about 600 metres below the ocean surface by a high-definition camera on a remote operated vehicle, called 'Subastian'. Deep-sea biologist Kat Bolstad, from Auckland University of Technology, was not on the trip but helped identify the species in the footage. 'We're finally seeing confirmed footage of this animal that some of us have been studying and dreaming about for decades,'she said.'We get to introduce the live colossal squid to the world as this beautiful little delicate animal that highlights the magnificence of a lot of deep-sea creatures without some of that 'monster' hype.' Aaron Evans, who studies glass squids, was also asked by the Schmidt Ocean Institute to confirm the footage was of a colossal squid. Dr Evans said it appeared to be a juvenile of the species that had grown out of its 'baby' phase. 'It no longer has stalked eyes. The eyes are part of the head itself,' he said. 'We could think of this maybe as a 'teenager' squid … it's still got a lot of growing to do.'Marine biologist and giant squid expert Steve O'Shea, who was not part of the expedition, said to his knowledge it was the first time a colossal squid, adult or juvenile, had been filmed in its natural habitat. 'It is lovely to see this species being filmed by scientists in a non-invasive way, alive rather than dead on a trawler deck or mangled in a net,' he said. Giant vs colossal squid, what's the difference? Colossal squids are considered the largest cephalopods by mass, weighing up to half a tonne. Conservative estimates suggest colossal squid get up to about 7m, including its two massive trailing tentacles, but lengths of more than 10m have been hypothesised. They have the largest eyeballs of any living creature at 27.5 centimetres in diameter, which is a little bigger than a basketball. The giant squid (Architeuthis dux) is weighs less than a colossal squid but is longer, with the longest on record being 13m long. Giant squid are found in all of the world's oceans but it wasn't until 2012 when high-definition colour video was taken of adults in waters off Japan. It was also filmed in the Gulf of Mexico in 2019. But similar vision of adult colossal squid has eluded scientists. What we knew until now about colossal squid has mostly come from a handful of specimens. The most intact is a female squid caught in the Ross Sea in 2007, now displayed at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in Wellington. She was brought up from about 1,500m deep, hanging onto a toothfish caught by commercial fishers. She weighed about 470 kilograms. Another ocean exploration not-for-profit organisation called Kolossal previously filmed a glass squid in 2023 they thought could be a juvenile colossal squid but the footage was too grainy and the species' identity has not been verified. Dr Bolstad said the opportunity to see a live juvenile colossal squid provided some insights into the species.'It's got … large rust-red, brown chromatophores [cells that produce colour],' she said. 'The spots on the mantle [the tube-like body] tells us that it almost certainly can switch back and forth between being completely transparent ... to being quite opaque.'But Dr O'Shea said there was not too much we could learn from the video since scientists had already collected several juvenile specimens in the past. He said there were still so many unanswered questions when it came to the colossal squid.'How does its behaviour change throughout its life cycle? What does the male look like? How long does the species live and how fast does it grow? 'An expedition into these waters is needed, and its sole objective must be to learn about this animal.'Will an adult colossal squid ever be filmed in the deep? The Schmidt Ocean Institute won't be heading back towards Antarctica until 2028, so if an adult is filmed in the deep in the next few years, it will be by another group. There is ongoing research as to whether environmental DNA testing could help narrow down locations for trying to film adult squid. Dr Evans said unlike the giant squid, there weren't as many opportunities to bump into a colossal species due to the remoteness of its home. The urge to avoid noisy equipment may also hinder the search. 'The colossal squid in particular has ginormous eyes,' Dr Evans said.'It's able to see the remotely operated vehicle long before the remotely operated vehicle sees it. 'So most adult colossal squid are probably going to try and want to get out of the area as much as possible because, from their perspective, anytime something large is coming towards them, it's not a good thing.'The colossal squid is prey for sleeper sharks and sperm whales, with squid beaks often found in the predators' stomach. Dr Bolstad said different strategies were needed to try not to scare the squid and instead attract it to cameras, 'which is an idea that several different research teams have been developing'. Although it will be a challenge, marine scientist and Kolossal founder Matt Mulrennan believes colossal-sized adult squids are out there waiting in Antarctica to be filmed. 'The hunt continues.'Dr Michelle Taylor led the voyage to the region near Antarctica, which is so secluded the nearest humans were hundreds of miles away in orbit on the International Space Station. The School of Life Sciences researcher was joined by PhD student Oenone Scott - who described the trip as a 'dream come true'. The 35-day expedition that captured the footage of the colossal squid was an Ocean Census flagship expedition searching for new marine life – a collaboration between Schmidt Ocean Institute, the Nippon Foundation-Nekton Ocean Census, and GoSouth, a joint project between the University of Plymouth (UK), GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research (Germany), and the British Antarctic Survey. 'It's incredible that we can leverage the power of the taxonomic community through R/V Falkor (too) telepresence while we are out at sea,' said the expedition's chief scientist, Dr Taylor, who led The Nippon Foundation-Nekton Ocean Census team on the South Sandwich Islands expedition.'The Ocean Census international science network is proud to work together with the Schmidt Ocean Institute to accelerate species discovery and expand our knowledge of ocean life, live online with the world's science community.' An international team of scientists and crew on board Schmidt Ocean Institute's research vessel Falkor (too) was the first to film the colossal squid (Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni) in its natural environment. The 30-centimeter juvenile squid (nearly one foot long) was captured on video at a depth of 600 meters (1968 feet) by the Institute's remotely operated vehicle (ROV) SuBastian. The sighting occurred on March 9 on an expedition near the South Sandwich Islands in the South Atlantic Ocean. This year is the 100-year anniversary of the identification and formal naming of the colossal squid, a member of the glass squid family (Cranchiidae). Additionally, on January 25 a team on the previous Falkor (too) expedition filmed the first confirmed footage of the glacial glass squid (Galiteuthis glacialis) in the Southern Ocean near Antarctica. G. glacialis is another glass squid species that has never been seen alive in its natural environment before. The 35-day expedition that captured the footage of the colossal squid was an Ocean Census flagship expedition searching for new marine life – a collaboration between Schmidt Ocean Institute, the Nippon Foundation-Nekton Ocean Census, and GoSouth, a joint project between the University of Plymouth (UK), GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research (Germany), and the British Antarctic Survey.'It's exciting to see the first in situ footage of a juvenile colossal and humbling to think that they have no idea that humans exist,' said Dr. Kat Bolstad of the Auckland University of Technology, one of the independent scientific experts the team consulted to verify the footage. 'For 100 years, we have mainly encountered them as prey remains in whale and seabird stomachs and as predators of harvested toothfish.'Colossal squid are estimated to grow up to seven meters (23 feet) in length and can weigh as much as 500 kilograms (1100 lbs), making them the heaviest invertebrate on the planet. Little is known about the colossal squid's life cycle, but eventually, they lose the see-through appearance of the juveniles. Dying adults have previously been filmed by fishermen, but have never been seen alive at depth. Dr. Aaron Evans, another independent expert on the glass squid family, also confirmed the footage of both squids. Bolstad and Evans said one of the most distinguishing characteristics of colossal squid is the presence of hooks on the middle of their eight arms, which help differentiate them from G. glacialis. Otherwise juvenile colossal squid and G. glacialis are similar, with transparent bodies and sharp hooks at the end of their two longer tentacles.'It's incredible that we can leverage the power of the taxonomic community through R/V Falkor (too) telepresence while we are out at sea,' said the expedition's chief scientist, Dr. Michelle Taylor of the University of Essex, who led The Nippon Foundation-Nekton Ocean Census team on the South Sandwich Islands expedition. 'The Ocean Census international science network is proud to work together with the Schmidt Ocean Institute to accelerate species discovery and expand our knowledge of ocean life, live online with the world's science community.'The first confirmed footage of the G. glacialis was filmed in the Bellingshausen Sea near Antarctica during the Schmidt Ocean Institute's January expedition, which examined the seafloor after an iceberg the size of Chicago calved from the George VI ice shelf. On board was deep-sea expert Dr. Thom Linley from the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, who alerted his colleague, Bolstad, as he watched the ROV footage from the vessel's mission control room. In the footage, taken at 687 meters (2254 feet), the transparent G. glacialis positions its arms loosely above its head, similar to the cockatoo pose commonly observed in other glass squids. 'The first sighting of two different squids on back-to-back expeditions is remarkable and shows how little we have seen of the magnificent inhabitants of the Southern Ocean,' said Schmidt Ocean Institute's executive director, Dr. Jyotika Virmani.'Fortunately, we caught enough high-resolution imagery of these creatures to allow the global experts, who were not on the vessel, to identify both species.' To date, the Schmidt Ocean Institute's ROV SuBastian has captured the first confirmed footage of at least four squid species in the wild, including the Spirula spirula (Ram's Horn Squid) in 2020 and the Promachoteuthis in 2024, with one more first sighting yet to be confirmed. 'These unforgettable moments continue to remind us that the Ocean is brimming with mysteries yet to be solved,' Virmani said.",263,Medium,2067,"[{'version': 'Human', 'Compression Ratio': 0.12487462390000001}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Compression Ratio': 0.1459378134}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Compression Ratio': 0.129889669}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Novel N-gram %': 35.6060606061}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Novel N-gram %': 11.1940298507}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Novel N-gram %': 12.6126126126}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Flesch Reading Ease': 36.4036692223, 'Flesch-Kincaid Grade': 13.8052500913, 'Gunning Fog': 16.4441036875, 'SMOG Index': 15.4299091752}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Flesch Reading Ease': 54.3754509284, 'Flesch-Kincaid Grade': 11.2168965517, 'Gunning Fog': 13.8885941645, 'SMOG Index': 13.1499198651}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Flesch Reading Ease': 40.0909015444, 'Flesch-Kincaid Grade': 14.1017335907, 'Gunning Fog': 17.7731274131, 'SMOG Index': 15.6451}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Distinct-1': 0.8198757764, 'Distinct-2': 0.975}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Distinct-1': 0.8170731707000001, 'Distinct-2': 0.9754601227}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Distinct-1': 0.74, 'Distinct-2': 0.9597315436}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'TP': 35, 'FP': 100, 'FN': 26, 'Keyword Precision': 0.2592592593, 'Keyword Recall': 0.5737704918000001, 'Keyword F1': 0.3571428571, 'Keywords Found': 'bolstad, captured, census, colossal, community, confirmed, day, deep, expedition, falkor, footage, glass, institute, international, islands, juvenile, life, marine, near, new, ocean, operated, research, said, sandwich, schmidt, sea, south, species, squid, team, time, university, vehicle, video', 'Keywords Missing': 'adult, antarctica, caught, cycle, does, evans, feet, filmed, foundation, giant, glacialis, habitat, led, little, live, long, longer, natural, nekton, nippon, rov, science, scientists, specimens, squids, world'}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'TP': 38, 'FP': 107, 'FN': 23, 'Keyword Precision': 0.26206896550000003, 'Keyword Recall': 0.6229508197, 'Keyword F1': 0.36893203880000003, 'Keywords Found': 'adult, bolstad, captured, colossal, confirmed, deep, evans, expedition, filmed, footage, giant, glass, habitat, institute, islands, juvenile, little, live, long, longer, marine, natural, near, ocean, operated, research, said, sandwich, schmidt, sea, south, species, squid, squids, time, university, vehicle, world', 'Keywords Missing': 'antarctica, caught, census, community, cycle, day, does, falkor, feet, foundation, glacialis, international, led, life, nekton, new, nippon, rov, science, scientists, specimens, team, video'}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'TP': 41, 'FP': 84, 'FN': 20, 'Keyword Precision': 0.328, 'Keyword Recall': 0.6721311475, 'Keyword F1': 0.4408602151, 'Keywords Found': 'adult, antarctica, captured, caught, census, colossal, cycle, day, deep, expedition, falkor, filmed, footage, foundation, giant, habitat, institute, juvenile, life, little, marine, natural, nekton, new, nippon, ocean, operated, research, rov, said, schmidt, scientists, sea, species, specimens, squid, team, time, university, vehicle, world', 'Keywords Missing': 'bolstad, community, confirmed, does, evans, feet, glacialis, glass, international, islands, led, live, long, longer, near, sandwich, science, south, squids, video'}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Jaccard Similarity (vs Human)': 1.0}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Jaccard Similarity (vs Human)': 0.17180616740000001}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Jaccard Similarity (vs Human)': 0.1682692308}]","[{'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'ROUGE-1 F1 (vs Human)': 0.5390070922, 'ROUGE-2 F1 (vs Human)': 0.256227758, 'ROUGE-L F1 (vs Human)': 0.24113475180000002}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'ROUGE-1 F1 (vs Human)': 0.4812030075, 'ROUGE-2 F1 (vs Human)': 0.2, 'ROUGE-L F1 (vs Human)': 0.2406015038}]","[{'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'BERTScore P (vs Human)': 0.9609348774, 'BERTScore R (vs Human)': 0.9636927843, 'BERTScore F1 (vs Human)': 0.9623118639}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'BERTScore P (vs Human)': 0.9616078734000001, 'BERTScore R (vs Human)': 0.9622668028, 'BERTScore F1 (vs Human)': 0.9619372487000001}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Q2 Model Output': '1', 'Q2_score': 1}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Q2 Model Output': '1', 'Q2_score': 1}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Q2 Model Output': '1', 'Q2_score': 1}]","[{'Human_vs_Plain_winner': 'Plain LLM', 'Plain_vs_Human_winner': 'Plain LLM', 'Human_vs_RAG_winner': 'RAG LLM', 'RAG_vs_Human_winner': 'Human', 'RAG_vs_Plain_winner': 'Plain LLM', 'Plain_vs_RAG_winner': 'Plain LLM'}, {'Human_vs_Plain_confidence_score': 4, 'Plain_vs_Human_confidence_score': 4, 'Human_vs_RAG_confidence_score': 4, 'RAG_vs_Human_confidence_score': 4, 'RAG_vs_Plain_confidence_score': 4, 'Plain_vs_RAG_confidence_score': 4}, {'Human_vs_Plain_reasoning_text': 'Article 2 is better than Article 1 because it provides more detailed information about the discovery, including quotes from experts in the field.

Friday's agreement would extend to titles held by Activision in the event the acquisition is successful.Reuters described the Microsoft-Nware deal as an attempt to provide reassurance that the acquisition of Activision would not harm competition.Microsoft has previously signed agreements with companies, including Nvidia and Boosteroid, to allow streaming both Activision and Microsoft titles on their services. Both companies spoke up against CMA's decision, with Nvidia tweeting 'we see this deal as a benefit to cloud gaming and hope for a positive resolution'. Addressing these agreements, the CMA said 'implementing the ineffective remedy would have replaced market forces with ongoing regulatory obligations overseen by the CMA, when competitive forces in a free market are much better placed to achieve the right outcome' and 'such remedies are described as 'behavioural' because they seek to regulate the behaviour of the businesses… contrary to their commercial incentives.' The CMA specified that Microsoft's proposals 'did not sufficiently cover different cloud gaming service business models, including multigame subscription services' and are 'not sufficiently open to providers who might wish to offer versions of games on PC operating systems other than Windows.'Microsoft announced their intentions to challenge the CMA's decision, with Activision saying they would 'work aggressively with Microsoft to reverse this on appeal'.In the US, the Federal Trade Commission filed a suit to stop the purchase of Activision. According to Reuters, European regulators are expected to make a decision by May 22.","['https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-signs-10-year-deal-with-spains-nware-after-uk-blocks-activision-bid-2023-04-28/',

tab games to the Spanish cloud-gaming platform, days after Britain blocked its $69 billion buyout of the 'Call of Duty' maker. The agreement marks the latest effort by Microsoft to ease fears its purchase of Activision would hinder competition in cloud gaming, which was the reason cited by the Competition and Markets Authority to veto the biggest deal in gaming.'While it's still early for the emerging cloud segment in gaming, this new partnership combined with our other recent commitments will make more popular games available on more cloud game streaming services than they are today,' Microsoft President Brad Smith said. The Xbox console maker, which plans to appeal CMA's decision, has signed similar deals with the owners of streaming platforms including Valve Corp, Nvidia, opens new tab and Boosteroid. It had also offered Sony - a vocal opponent of the deal - a 10-year 'Call of Duty' license, in line with an agreement to bring the multi-billion dollar franchise to Nintendo's Switch. In its decision on Wednesday, the CMA said Microsoft had an estimated 60%-70% of global cloud gaming services as well as competitive advantages including owning Xbox, PC operating system Windows and cloud provider Azure. The Activision deal is the biggest involving technology companies the regulator has blocked. Europe will decide on the deal by May 22. The U. S. Federal Trade Commission is also seeking to block it. Microsoft shares were slightly lower in U. S. premarket trading, while those of Activision ticked up 0.2%. Technology company Microsoft has joined forces with the cloud gaming platform Nware in Madrid just days after its proposed $69 billion takeover of gaming company Activision Blizzard was blocked by the UK's antitrust watchdog. The Redmond-headquartered company has signed a 10-year deal with Nware to bring Xbox and Activision Blizzard games to the European cloud-gaming platform.'Microsoft and European cloud gaming platform Nware have signed a 10-year agreement to stream PC games built by Xbox on its platform, as well as Activision Blizzard titles after the acquisition closes,' Microsoft president Brad Smith said on Twitter.'While it's still early for the emerging cloud segment in gaming, this new partnership combined with our other recent commitments will make more popular games available on more cloud game streaming services than they are today,' he added. The entities did not disclose financial details of the deal. In the past, the Xbox console maker has signed similar deals with the owners of various streaming platforms such as Valve Corp, Ubitus, Nvidia and Boosteroid. This week, Microsoft reported a 9 per cent jump in its net profit to $18.3 billion in the three months to the end of March. Revenue during the January-March period jumped 7 per cent to $52.9 billion, exceeding analysts' expectations of $51.02 billion. Xbox content and services revenue was up 3 per cent in the quarter. Earlier this week, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority prevented the Microsoft and Activision deal, saying it 'would alter the future of the fast-growing cloud-gaming market, leading to reduced innovation and less choice for UK gamers over the years to come'. Both Microsoft and Activision plan to challenge the decision. Mr Smith said the decision to stop the deal 'had shaken confidence in the UK tech industry' and was 'probably the darkest day in our four decades in Britain'. Activision said it would 'work aggressively with Microsoft to reverse this on appeal'. The UK blocked Microsoft from buying Activision Blizzard in a bid to protect competition in the growing cloud gaming market. But in a bit of irony, a pair of cloud gaming providers, including Nvidia, are advocating for the deal to go through, saying it'll be a boon to their platforms. On Thursday, Nvidia tweeted its support for Microsoft from its GeForce Now account. 'GeForce Now and other cloud gaming providers stand to gain an even deeper catalog of games if Microsoft's acquisition of Activision is completed,' the company wrote. 'We see this as a benefit to cloud gaming and hope for a positive resolution.'Another cloud gaming provider, Ukraine-based Boosteroid, also threw in its support behind Microsoft. 'Boosteroid team and our users disagree with the CMA's (the UK's Competition and Markets Authority's) decision against Microsoft's purchase of Activision,' the company wrote in its own tweet. 'We hope for a quick resolution to this question.'The companies issued the support likely because Nvidia and Boosteroid have inked agreements that'll let them benefit from Microsoft's proposed takeover of Activision Blizzard. Earlier this year, Microsoft signed 10-year deals to bring its games and Activision Blizzard titles to both GeForce Now and Boosteroid. But the agreements can only reach their full potential if regulators clear Microsoft's bid to buy Activision. On Friday, Microsoft went ahead and signed a new 10-year-deal with another cloud gaming provider, despite the UK's CMA declaring it would block the proposed acquisition. This time, Microsoft entered a partnership with Nware, a cloud gaming provider in Europe. The software giant has been striking deals with other gaming companies, including Nintendo, to reassure world regulators that the Microsoft-Activision deal won't harm competition. But the UK's CMA disagrees, citing Redmond's growing control in the emerging cloud gaming space. 'Microsoft already has important advantages in this market: it owns Windows, by far the leading PC operating system on which most PC games run; it has a global cloud infrastructure; and it has a strong gaming console and collection of games,' said CMA CEO Sarah Cardell. 'No other cloud gaming operator has this combination of advantages, which partly explains Microsoft's current UK market share of between 60-70%.'Thus, the CMA fears Microsoft would eventually have the incentive to make games exclusive to its own cloud gaming platforms, such as Xbox Game Pass. Microsoft's deals with other cloud gaming companies also wasn't enough to reassure UK regulators. 'Moreover, implementing the ineffective remedy would have replaced market forces with ongoing regulatory obligations overseen by the CMA, when competitive forces in a free market are much better placed to achieve the right outcome,' Cardell added. Microsoft plans on appealing the CMA's decision. But in the meantime, the UK regulator told the BBC: 'Activision is intertwined through different markets—it can't be separated for the UK. So this decision blocks the deal from happening globally.'In the meantime, the US Federal Trade Commission has sued to stop the deal. The European Union, on the other hand, is expected to announce a decision on the acquisition next month. The final decision to prevent the deal comes after Microsoft's proposed solution failed to effectively address the concerns in the cloud gaming sector, outlined in the Competition and Markets Authority's (CMA) provisional findings published in February. Microsoft entered into a $68.7 billion deal to buy Activision, one of the most popular video games publishers in the world, in January 2022. The CMA launched an in-depth review of the deal in September 2022, and in February 2023 provisionally found that the merger could make Microsoft even stronger in cloud gaming, stifling competition in this growing market. Cloud gaming concerns: The UK cloud gaming market is growing fast. Monthly active users in the UK more than tripled from the start of 2021 to the end of 2022. It is forecast to be worth up to £11 billion globally and £1 billion in the UK by 2026. By way of comparison, sales of recorded music in the UK in 2021 amounted to £1.1billion. Microsoft has a strong position in cloud gaming services and the evidence available to the CMA showed that Microsoft would find it commercially beneficial to make Activision's games exclusive to its own cloud gaming service. Microsoft already accounts for an estimated 60-70% of global cloud gaming services and has other important strengths in cloud gaming from owning Xbox, the leading PC operating system (Windows) and a global cloud computing infrastructure (Azure and Xbox Cloud Gaming). The deal would reinforce Microsoft's advantage in the market by giving it control over important gaming content such as Call of Duty, Overwatch, and World of Warcraft. The evidence available to the CMA indicates that, absent the merger, Activision would start providing games via cloud platforms in the foreseeable future. The cloud allows UK gamers to avoid buying expensive gaming consoles and PCs and gives them much more flexibility and choice as to how they play. Allowing Microsoft to take such a strong position in the cloud gaming market just as it begins to grow rapidly would risk undermining the innovation that is crucial to the development of these opportunities. The remedy: Microsoft submitted a proposal to address some of these concerns which the CMA examined in considerable depth. The proposed remedy set out requirements governing what games must be offered by Microsoft to what platforms and on what conditions over a ten-year period. Such remedies are described as 'behavioural' because they seek to regulate the behaviour of the businesses involved in a merger, requiring them to behave in a way which may be contrary to their commercial incentives. This therefore takes the form of a type of ongoing regulation of the sector, replacing market forces in a growing and dynamic market with mandated regulatory obligations ultimately overseen, and enforced by, the CMA – in this case at a global level. Microsoft's proposal contained a number of significant shortcomings connected with the growing and fast-moving nature of cloud gaming services: It did not sufficiently cover different cloud gaming service business models, including multigame subscription services. It was not sufficiently open to providers who might wish to offer versions of games on PC operating systems other than Windows. It would standardise the terms and conditions on which games are available, as opposed to them being determined by the dynamism and creativity of competition in the market, as would be expected in the absence of the merger. Given the remedy applies only to a defined set of Activision games, which can be streamed only in a defined set of cloud gaming services, provided they are purchased in a defined set of online stores, there are significant risks of disagreement and conflict between Microsoft and cloud gaming service providers, particularly over a ten-year period in a rapidly changing market. Accepting Microsoft's remedy would inevitably require some degree of regulatory oversight by the CMA. By contrast, preventing the merger would effectively allow market forces to continue to operate and shape the development of cloud gaming without this regulatory intervention. Considering the potential benefits of the merger: The CMA carefully considered whether the benefit of having Activision's content available on Game Pass outweighed the harm that the merger would cause to competition in cloud gaming in the UK. The CMA found that this new payment option, while beneficial to some customers, would not outweigh the overall harm to competition (and, ultimately, UK gamers) arising from this merger, particularly given the incentive for Microsoft to increase the cost of a Game Pass subscription post-merger to reflect the addition of Activision's valuable games. Martin Coleman, chair of the independent panel of experts conducting this investigation, said: Gaming is the UK's largest entertainment sector. Cloud gaming is growing fast with the potential to change gaming by altering the way games are played, freeing people from the need to rely on expensive consoles and gaming PCs and giving them more choice over how and where they play games. This means that it is vital that we protect competition in this emerging and exciting market. Microsoft already enjoys a powerful position and head start over other competitors in cloud gaming and this deal would strengthen that advantage giving it the ability to undermine new and innovative competitors. Microsoft engaged constructively with us to try to address these issues and we are grateful for that, but their proposals were not effective to remedy our concerns and would have replaced competition with ineffective regulation in a new and dynamic market. Cloud gaming needs a free, competitive market to drive innovation and choice. That is best achieved by allowing the current competitive dynamics in cloud gaming to continue to do their job.",360,Medium,2090,"[{'version': 'Human', 'Compression Ratio': 0.1711177052}, {'version':

The CMA launched an in-depth review of the deal in September 2022, and in February 2023 provisionally found that the merger could make Microsoft even stronger in cloud gaming, stifling competition in this growing market. The final decision to prevent the deal comes after Microsoft's proposed solution failed to effectively address the concerns in the cloud gaming sector, outlined in the CMA's provisional findings published in February.

India, dominant throughout the tournament, made a rampant start in pursuit of 252 only to lose three wickets for 17 runs, including captain Rohit Sharma for 76 and Virat Kohli for one. Shreyas Iyer followed for 48 and Axar Patel holed out on 29 to leave 49 runs to get from 51 balls. Hardik Pandya took India closer and, after he fell for 18, KL Rahul finished 34 not out as Ravindra Jadeja hit the winning runs with an over to spare. That India always still felt ahead of the game was thanks to their spinners once again impressing by limiting New Zealand to 251-7. Victory confirms India's place as the world's premier white-ball side. Since being beaten in the final of the 2023 World Cup they have won the T20 World Cup and the Champions Trophy - a record third time they have won this event but first since 2013. They were loudly supported by a partisan crowd in Dubai, fireworks erupting into the night sky as the players rushed onto the field at the final moment, but disappointment remained that this final was not played in Lahore, which would have been the case had India not refused to travel to Pakistan. Champions in 2013. Runner-up in 2017. Champions in 2025, again. And I suspect this will be really special for the Indian team as they go through to the end undefeated. Sidharth Monga's report is up. Do have a read if you missed any of the game. Thanks for tuning in tonight. Hope you had as much fun as we did bringing it to you. Till then, this is me Ashish Pant, signing off on behalf of Ekanth, Ranjith and Raghav. Ciao!9.09pm Rohit now steps forward to collect the Champions Trophy from Jay Shah, the ICC Chair. Huge smiles as Rohit poses for the shutterbugs. The rest of the Indian team now steps in. Lots of champagne flowing, lots of dancing happening. The Dubai skyline is lit by the fireworks. All smiles in the Indian camp and I am sure this will continue deep into the night. The team now poses behind the Champions logo. Kohli has absolutely drenched Pant in champagne. Hardik gets across and plants the Champions Trophy right in the centre of the pitch, and then brings out his iconic pose as if to say... what's the fuss all about. Rohit is calling the players for a lap of honour around the stadium. The stadium DJ is belting out Chak de India with the entire stadium joining in. Shreyas Iyer breaks out into a jig. They also pose for a picture with the support staff even as Harshit Rana breaks out into a bhangra. The Indian team will now step forward to collect their white blazers which is presented to the team winning the Champions Trophy. Varun, Gill, Iyer come up first to collect the jacket from Roger Binny. Here comes Jadeja followed by Kohli. Hardik Pandya next. Pant, Axar, KL Rahul, Harshit Rana, Mohammed Shami, Arshdeep Singh, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav and last but not least, here comes Rohit to collect his jacket. Rohit Sharma (Captain/Skipper of India): I appreciate everyone who came to support us. The crowd has been amazing. Not our home ground but they made it our home ground. Very satisfying win. Right form the beginning our spinners... there is too much expectation but they never disappointed. It helped them and we used that to our advantage. We were very consistent with our bowling. [KL] A very solid mind, never gets overawed with the pressure around him. He finished off the game for us. He picks the right shot to play in the pressure situation which allows the rest of the batters to play freely. For eg, Hardik. The overall batsmanship shown by all the batters was special.[On Chakravarthy] He has something different about him. When you are playing on such a pitch, you want to have something like him. He didn't start but played later and got wickets. Luckily for us, it came to use. Very grateful for the fans. We really appreciate their support. It may not be seen as useful but when they come out, it makes a difference. The victorious Indian team now steps forward to pick up their winning medals Mitchell Santner (Captain or Skipper of New Zealand): It's been a good tournament. We have been challenged along the way and the way we have grown as a group. We lost to a better side today. Everyone contributed to the tournament and put their hands up at different rimes. It was good bowling. We lost a couple of wickets after the powerplay and they really got the squeeze on. Credit to how their spinners how they bowled. They are world-class bowlers. We were 20 or 25 under to what we were looking for.[Phillips catch] That man he keeps doing it. The way Rohit and Gill went about it was great. Rohit going at almost run a ball on that wicket was outstanding. We knew the game could change quickly and that happened.[On Ravindra] We have seen how he steps up in these tournaments. With the ball as well he stepped up. He understands the game at such a young age. He's got a massive future. Even today, he went over a run a ball. [First ICC tournament as captain] It has been very enjoyable. Made easy by the group. Different guys stepping up at different times makes it easy. We have had a few challenges but we have adapted. It has been a great tournament. First of, there are medals presented to the match referee and the on-field umpires, third umpire and fourth umpire. Next up, the runner-up medals being distributed to the NZ team. Presentation time -- Rachin Ravindra is the player of the tournament: Certainly is bitter-sweet. Was a glorious final. The individual accolades are great and playing for a team is great. [What makes you such a great ICC player?]Maybe we get to play on a good wicket. I like playing tournament cricket because you are playing for a goal. Very proud of my past. Have so many people to thank. It would have been nice to have the icing on the cake with the trophy but cricket is a cruel game. All members of the squad have a part to play. There isn't an established player or a newbie. We go about our business and play like a team. Rohit Sharma is the player of the match: It is very nice. We played some good cricket though the tournament. To have the result our way is a great feeling. [Aggressive style] Not natural to me, but something I really wanted to do. When you are doing something different, you have to have the backing of the team and management. I spoke to Rahul bhai earlier and now Gauti bhai as well. It is something I really wanted to do. I have played all these years in a different style, and now we are getting the results with this. We have to understand the nature of the surfaces and I was very clear about how I wanted to execute the first five-six overs. I have gotten out as well earlier, but the execution matters. The depth gives me the freedom and it helps. With Jadeja coming at 8, it gives you the confidence to go hard up front. As long as I am clear in my mind, it is great. Virat Kohli: It's been amazing, we wanted to bounce back after a tough Australia tour. Lovely playing with a bunch of amazing youngsters. They're stepping up and taking India in the right direction. After playing for so long, you look forward to playing under pressure. To win titles, the whole team has to step up in different games. People have played such impactful knocks and had spells, that collective effort is what has done it for us. I try to speak to these guys, try to share my experience, tell them how I've played for so long. When you leave, you want to leave in a better position. So many impactful knocks Gill, Shreyas, Rahul, et al have played. The team is in good hands. We've always been in awe of what NZ can do with limited no.of players. They come in with a set plan. Every fielder knows where the bowler will bowl. They have immense belief in their skills, best fielding side. Huge shoutout to them. Sad to see a very good friend (Kane Williamson) on the losing side, only love between us. Shubman Gill: Felt amazing. For the most time, I sat back and enjoyed Rohit's batting. He told me doesn't matter how the scoreboard gap is, the aim was to bat till the end. We missed out in 2023, happy to win eight ODIs back to back. Seeing the intensity with which he plays with is amazing. He keeps telling us to give it everything and backs it up. NZ are very consistent and execute plans accurately. We know they give it their all. They showed it tonight with the consistency. Kuldeep Yadav: Luckily my batting wasn't needed. KL and Hardik did brilliantly. I don't believe in favorites tags but we have been doing brilliantly. This win is dedicated to our fans. It is easy to say that four spinners in the team, but it is very tough to manage four spinners. There was a lot of planning and all credit to Rohit bhai. Big party tonight. Varun Chakravarthy: It was a sudden inclusion and I didn't expect it to turn out like this. It's a dream come true. We had to stick to our lengths. Hardik Pandya: Always amazing to win an ICC event. I remember 2017 very closely, couldn't finish that time. Very pleased to have done it here. KL was calm, he took his chances at the right time. He has immense talent, no one can time it as well as him. Shreyas Iyer: Feeling ecstatic. This is my first ICC trophy, kinda overwhelmed looking at each and everyone in the dressing room. I love to go under pressure, I thrive. Not able to get a big one but immensely satisfying to contribute to win. These are the lucky earrings, they'll stay on. Ravindra Jadeja: That is how it is with me; sometimes a hero, sometimes a zero. The wicket was not easy for a new batter. Hardik and KL were great. Winning the CT is a huge thing. If you don't win a big tournament after playing so long, it hurts. KL Rahul: Not sure I can say this on air but I was s****** myself. As confident as I could be that I could get over the line. Keeping composure is all that matters, happy to have done it this time. I've batted in times like this in three out of the five games. Hard to put in words, but the team has pure skill. The way we've all had to play cricket growing up, we faced pressure from the time we became professional cricketers. The BCCI have groomed all of them and we've challenging ourselves to get better. Some pitch-side interviews -- Mustafa Moudi : '2022 - Reached SF but Lost, 2023 - Reached Finals of WTC and WC but lost both the Finals, 2024 - Won the T20 WC and 2025 - Won the CT. India is only improving under Rohit Sharma in ICC Tournaments!!', Niklesh : 'Jadeja scoring the winning runs will complete the circle from 2019 cwc', Uzair: 'Not sure why Jamieson wasn't given the ball instead of Rourke earlier. He bowled 4 good overs earlier.', Gaurav Dhiman: 'While I am not denying that India had an advantage of not having to travel over the other teams, they also did not win a single toss in the tournament. So all opponents had the chance to make the better use of the conditions on that day but India still emerged victorious.'. Teams to lose all tosses in a men's ODI series/tournament but did not lose a game (Min: 5 matches) -- New Zealand vs India, 2014 (4 wins, 1 tie), England vs Australia, 2018 (5 wins) and India in Champions Trophy 2025 (5 wins).8.20pm The Dubai sky is lit up as India register claim their third Champions Trophy title. Lots of smiles and handshakes in the middle. Jadeja, Harshit Rana and Arshdeep Singh break into a Gangnam style dance. Kohli and Rohit do the dandiya dance with the stumps. Varun Chakravarthy is all smiles. He has turned the narrative in India's favour right from the time he's come into the team. The Indian chase got off to a super start thanks largely to Rohit Sharma, who put on 105-run stand for the opening wicket. Then New Zealand bounced back with three quick wickets with spin doing the damage. But, Axar Patel and Shreyas Iyer steadied the ship to take the team forward. A couple of quick wickets brought NZ back again, but Rahul and Pandya took India to the finishing line before Jadeja finished things off. A word on the brilliance of New Zealand. They didn't have their best bowler in the game, yet pushed India to the brink. What the captains said -- Mitchell Santner: We're going to have a bat first. Looks like a pretty good wicket, similar to the one we played India here a week ago. Want to get runs on the board and see what happens. Obviously expected a few blue shirts, great atmosphere, great ground. Going to be slightly different from what we got in Pakistan. We saw how India played and what they got out of it. Hope it [the pitch] slows down a bit later. Different guys have stepped up at different times. You want guys firing from the start and we have done that, as have India. Unfortunately Matt Henry has been ruled out. We've got Nathan Smith coming in. Rohit Sharma: We've been here enough, batted first and bowled first. Don't really mind batting second. It hasn't changed much. We've chased and won as well. It does give you a lot of confidence, takes the toss away from the game. At the end of the day, what matters is how well you want to play. That's what we've spoken about in the dressing room, not to worry about the toss and to just play well, that's what we've done and we have to do today as well. New Zealand have been a very good team over the past so many years, they tend to play good cricket in ICC tournaments. The challenge for us is to play well against them now. Same team for us.",381,Medium,2521,"[{'version': 'Human', 'Compression Ratio': 0.146499393}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Compression Ratio': 0.1262646702}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Compression Ratio': 0.0999595306}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Novel N-gram %': 52.5510204082}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Novel N-gram %': 21.7105263158}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Novel N-gram %': 25.8064516129}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Flesch Reading Ease': 63.0249759789, 'Flesch-Kincaid Grade': 8.3786476099, 'Gunning Fog': 10.384049964, 'SMOG Index': 10.9402548164}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Flesch Reading Ease': 62.883974359, 'Flesch-Kincaid Grade': 8.7943589744, 'Gunning Fog': 10.3948717949, 'SMOG Index': 10.746095033}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Flesch Reading Ease': 61.1637651822, 'Flesch-Kincaid Grade': 9.448340081, 'Gunning Fog': 11.1627530364, 'SMOG Index': 11.2081432602}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Distinct-1': 0.8099173554, 'Distinct-2': 0.9751037344000001}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Distinct-1': 0.8128342246, 'Distinct-2': 0.9731182796000001}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Distinct-1': 0.7848101266, 'Distinct-2': 0.923566879}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'TP': 36, 'FP': 146, 'FN': 35, 'Keyword Precision': 0.1978021978, 'Keyword Recall': 0.5070422535, 'Keyword F1': 0.2845849802, 'Keywords Found': '2025, amazing, better, captain, champions, cricket, different, dubai, final, gill, good, icc, india, iyer, kohli, lost, new, player, rahul, ravindra, rohit, runs, sharma, shreyas, spinners, start, team, tournament, trophy, way, wicket, wickets, win, winning, won, zealand', 'Keywords Missing': 'ball, collect, come, did, didn, doing, don, earlier, easy, forward, game, got, great, guys, hardik, huge, indian, jadeja, leave, like, long, pandya, pitch, play, played, playing, pressure, really, right, smiles, steps, time, want, wanted, world'}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'TP': 39, 'FP': 119, 'FN': 32, 'Keyword Precision': 0.24683544300000002, 'Keyword Recall': 0.5492957746, 'Keyword F1': 0.3406113537, 'Keywords Found': '2025, ball, better, captain, champions, dubai, final, forward, game, got, hardik, india, indian, iyer, jadeja, kohli, lost, new, pandya, player, rahul, ravindra, really, rohit, runs, sharma, shreyas, spinners, start, team, time, tournament, trophy, wicket, wickets, winning, won, world, zealand', 'Keywords Missing': 'amazing, collect, come, cricket, did, didn, different, doing, don, earlier, easy, gill, good, great, guys, huge, icc, leave, like, long, pitch, play, played, playing, pressure, right, smiles, steps, want, wanted, way, win'}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'TP': 36, 'FP': 94, 'FN': 35, 'Keyword Precision': 0.2769230769, 'Keyword Recall': 0.5070422535, 'Keyword F1': 0.3582089552, 'Keywords Found': '2025, ball, captain, champions, collect, dubai, final, forward, hardik, icc, india, indian, iyer, jadeja, kohli, new, pandya, pitch, rahul, ravindra, right, rohit, runs, sharma, shreyas, spinners, start, team, tournament, trophy, wickets, win, winning, won, world, zealand', 'Keywords Missing': 'amazing, better, come, cricket, did, didn, different, doing, don, earlier, easy, game, gill, good, got, great, guys, huge, leave, like, long, lost, play, played, player, playing, pressure, really, smiles, steps, time, want, wanted, way, wicket'}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Jaccard Similarity (vs Human)': 1.0}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Jaccard Similarity (vs Human)': 0.1447368421}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Jaccard Similarity (vs Human)': 0.13475177300000002}]","[{'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'ROUGE-1 F1 (vs Human)': 0.5192582026, 'ROUGE-2 F1 (vs Human)': 0.1716738197, 'ROUGE-L F1 (vs Human)': 0.2054208274}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'ROUGE-1 F1 (vs Human)': 0.44233807270000003, 'ROUGE-2 F1 (vs Human)': 0.1267828843, 'ROUGE-L F1 (vs Human)': 0.20853080570000002}]","[{'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'BERTScore P (vs Human)': 0.9612627625000001, 'BERTScore R (vs Human)': 0.9574958682, 'BERTScore F1 (vs Human)': 0.9593756199000001}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'BERTScore P (vs Human)': 0.9604625702, 'BERTScore R (vs Human)': 0.9538484812, 'BERTScore F1 (vs Human)': 0.9571441412}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Q2 Model Output': '1', 'Q2_score': 1}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Q2 Model Output': '1', 'Q2_score': 1}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Q2 Model Output': '1', 'Q2_score': 1}]","[{'Human_vs_Plain_winner': 'Plain LLM', 'Plain_vs_Human_winner': 'Plain LLM', 'Human_vs_RAG_winner': 'Human', 'RAG_vs_Human_winner': 'RAG LLM', 'RAG_vs_Plain_winner': 'RAG LLM', 'Plain_vs_RAG_winner': 'Plain LLM'}, {'Human_vs_Plain_confidence_score': 4, 'Plain_vs_Human_confidence_score': 4, 'Human_vs_RAG_confidence_score': 4, 'RAG_vs_Human_confidence_score': 4, 'RAG_vs_Plain_confidence_score': 4, 'Plain_vs_RAG_confidence_score': 4}, {'Human_vs_Plain_reasoning_text': ""Article 2 provides more accurate information about the match, including the correct number of runs scored by New Zealand (251) and the number of wickets taken by India's spinners (Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakravarthy).

2024-08-30,"SpaceX will return stranded astronauts in February 2025, NASA announces","https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/SpaceX_will_return_stranded_astronauts_in_February_2025,_NASA_announces/",Business & Technology,"On Saturday, NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) announced at a press conference that Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore would return home from the International Space Station (ISS) on a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft in February 2025. The Boeing Starliner, the spacecraft which had been expected to transport the crew from ISS earlier in June, would return to Earth 'un-crewed' — on autopilot with planned landing in a desert in New Mexico, possibly next month, the NASA announcement said. On its way to the ISS, Starliner has experienced helium leaks and several thruster malfunctions, which, according to National Public Radio (NPR, 'inexplicably conked out as Starliner approached the station.'. Steve Stich, the manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, said they didn't know if Starliner's thrusters would fail at critical moments. The Starliner test flight was Boeing's first crewed space mission; three previous attempts for this crewed mission had failed. The two NASA astronauts had been launched during Starliner's crewed test flight on June 5 for what was expected to be an eight-day long mission to the ISS. A successful mission is a requirement to certify Starliner for NASA's Commercial Crew Program. Due to the change of plans, the astronauts would remain at ISS for several months as part of Expedition 71/72. Boeing wrote on social media about its commitment to safety and to cooperation with NASA, as they were continuing 'to focus, first and foremost, on the safety of the crew and spacecraft. We are executing the mission as determined by NASA, and we are preparing the spacecraft for a safe and successful uncrewed return.' The Crew Dragon would carry two astronauts to the ISS instead of the planned 4 to allow room for Williams and Wilmore, NASA announced. NASA said that SpaceX would reportedly leave Earth in September for the planned Crew-9 mission, with a change of plans to have only two crew on board, so that the remaining two free seats will be available for the stranded astronauts to return on Earth in February. SpaceX's Crew Dragon—certified in 2020—will undergo some changes before launching on September 24. The preparation to bring Williams and Wilmore home to their families includes additional cargo, adjusting the seats for the Dragon, and Dragon-specific spacesuits for the two astronauts. The preparation also adds in a contingency plan, providing the two a flight home on the Crew-8 spacecraft. To date, SpaceX had completed nine crewed flights to space for NASA and several commercial flights, BBC reported.","['https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-spacex-extend-us-media-deadline-for-crew-9-launch-to-station/',

S. media accreditation for the launch of the agency's ninth rotational mission of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft that will carry astronauts to the International Space Station. This mission is part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program. The application period for U. S. media and U. S. citizens representing international media organizations is extended until 11:59 p.m. EDT on Tuesday, Sept. 3. Media members who have already applied do not need to reapply. Launch of NASA's SpaceX Crew-9 mission, originally slated with four crew members, is targeted for no earlier than Tuesday, Sept. 24, from Space Launch Complex-40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. NASA announced astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will remain on station and return home in February 2025 aboard Dragon with two other crew members assigned to the Crew-9 mission, during a news conference on Aug. 24. The agency will share more information about the Crew-9 complement when details are finalized. NASA and SpaceX currently are working on several items before launch, including reconfiguring seats on the Dragon and adjusting the manifest to carry additional cargo, personal effects, and Dragon-specific spacesuits for Wilmore and Williams. NASA decided Saturday it's too risky to bring two astronauts back to Earth in Boeing's troubled new capsule, and they'll have to wait until next year for a ride home with SpaceX. What should have been a weeklong test flight for the pair will now last more than eight months. The seasoned pilots have been stuck at the International Space Station since the beginning of June. A cascade of vexing thruster failures and helium leaks in the new capsule marred their trip to the space station, and they ended up in a holding pattern as engineers conducted tests and debated what to do about the flight back. After almost three months, the decision finally came down from NASA's highest ranks on Saturday. Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will come back in a SpaceX capsule in February. Their empty Starliner capsule will undock in early September and attempt to return on autopilot with a touchdown in the New Mexico desert. As Starliner's test pilots, the pair should have overseen this critical last leg of the journey. 'A test flight by nature is neither safe nor routine,' said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. The decision 'is a result of a commitment to safety.' Nelson said lessons learned from NASA's two space shuttle accidents played a role. This time, he noted, open dialogue was encouraged rather than crushed. 'This has not been an easy decision, but it is absolutely the right one,' added Jim Free, NASA's associate administrator. It was a blow to Boeing, adding to the safety concerns plaguing the company on its airplane side. Boeing had counted on Starliner's first crew trip to revive the troubled spacecraft program after years of delays and ballooning costs. The company had insisted Starliner was safe based on all the recent thruster tests both in space and on the ground. Boeing did not participate in Saturday's news conference by NASA, but released a statement: 'Boeing continues to focus, first and foremost, on the safety of the crew and spacecraft.' The company said it is preparing the spacecraft 'for a safe and successful return.'Rand Corp's Jan Osburg, a senior engineer who specializes in aerospace and defense, said NASA made the right choice. 'But the U. S. is still left with egg on its face due to the Starliner design issues that should have been caught earlier.'Wilmore, 61, and Williams, 58, are both retired Navy captains with previous long-duration spaceflight experience. Before their June 5 launch from Cape Canaveral, Wilmore and Williams said their families bought into the uncertainty and stress of their professional careers decades ago. During their lone orbital news conference last month, the astronauts said they had trust in the thruster testing being conducted. They had no complaints, they added, and enjoyed pitching in with space station work. Wilmore's wife, Deanna, said she and their daughters, along with family and friends, 'were praying for a safe return on whatever spacecraft that may be.' While they are disappointed that he will be away longer, 'we know that it's the Lord's plan,' she said via text. Flight operations director Norm Knight said he talked to the astronauts Saturday and they fully support the decision to postpone their return. There were few options. The SpaceX capsule currently parked at the space station is reserved for the four residents who have been there since March. They will return in late September, their routine six-month stay extended a month by the Starliner dilemma. NASA said it would be unsafe to squeeze two more into the capsule, except in an emergency. The docked Russian Soyuz capsule is even tighter, capable of flying only three — two of them Russians wrapping up a yearlong stint. So Wilmore and Williams will wait for SpaceX's next taxi flight. It's due to launch in late September with two astronauts instead of the usual four. NASA is yanking two to make room for Wilmore and Williams on the return flight in late February. NASA said no serious consideration was given to asking SpaceX for a quick stand-alone rescue. Last year, the Russian Space Agency had to rush up a replacement Soyuz capsule for three men whose original craft was damaged by space junk. The switch pushed their six-month mission to just over a year. Former Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield, applauded the decision via X: 'Good to err on the side of caution for astronaut lives.' Long missions are 'what astronauts work their entire career for. I'd take it in a heartbeat!'Starliner's woes began long before its latest flight. Bad software fouled the first test flight without a crew in 2019, prompting a do-over in 2022. Then parachute and other issues cropped up, including a helium leak in the capsule's propellant system that nixed a launch attempt in May. The leak eventually was deemed to be isolated and small enough to pose no concern. But more leaks sprouted following liftoff, and five thrusters also failed. All but one of those small thrusters restarted in flight. But engineers were perplexed by ground testing that showed a thruster seal swelling and obstructing a propellant line. They theorized the seals in orbit may have expanded and then reverted to their normal size. Officials said the results marked the turning point, as their concerns grew. With all the uncertainty about how the thrusters might perform, 'There was too much risk for the crew,' Steve Stich, NASA's commercial crew program manager, told reporters. These 28 thrusters are vital. Besides needed for space station rendezvous, they keep the capsule pointed in the right direction at flight's end as bigger engines steer the craft out of orbit. Coming in crooked could result in catastrophe. With the Columbia disaster still fresh in many minds — the shuttle broke apart during reentry in 2003, killing all seven aboard — NASA made an extra effort to embrace open debate over Starliner's return capability. Despite Saturday's decision, NASA isn't giving up on Boeing. Nelson said he is '100%' certain that Starliner will fly again. NASA went into its commercial crew program a decade ago wanting two competing U. S. companies ferrying astronauts in the post-shuttle era. Boeing won the bigger contract: more than $4 billion, compared with SpaceX's $2.6 billion. With station supply runs already under its belt, SpaceX aced its first of now nine astronaut flights in 2020, while Boeing got bogged down in design flaws that set the company back more than $1 billion. NASA officials still hold out hope that Starliner's problems can be corrected in time for another crew flight in another year or so. Two Nasa astronauts who have been stuck in space for over two months will return to Earth in February 2025 with SpaceX. Nasa said the Boeing Starliner spacecraft the astronauts Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore had travelled to International Space Station (ISS) on would return to Earth 'un-crewed'. The pair took off on what was planned to be an eight-day mission on 5 June but will now spend around eight months in orbit. The Starliner experienced problems on its way to the ISS, including leaks of helium, which pushes fuel into the propulsion system. Several thrusters also did not work properly. Boeing and SpaceX were both awarded billion-dollar contracts by Nasa to provide commercial space flights for its astronauts. Boeing's was worth $4.2bn (£3.18bn) while SpaceX, which was founded by billionaire Elon Musk, got $2.6bn. SpaceX has so far sent nine crewed flights to space for Nasa, as well as some commercial missions, but this was Boeing's first attempt at a crewed mission. Engineers at Boeing and Nasa have spent months trying to understand the technical issues with the Starliner craft. They have been carrying out tests and gathering data, both in space and back on the Earth. Their hope was to pin down the root of the problems and find a way to return the astronauts home safely on Starliner. Nasa Administrator Bill Nelson said Boeing has been working closely with Nasa to understand what improvements need to be made to the spacecraft.'Space flight is a risk, even at its safest and even at its most routine, and a test flight, by nature, is neither safe nor routine,' he said.'Our core value is safety and it is our north star.'The decision has been made to extend the pair's stay on the ISS until February 2025 so they can return on a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft. The extra time allows SpaceX to launch its next vehicle, with lift-off scheduled for the end of September. It was supposed to have four astronauts on board, but will instead travel to the space station with two. This leaves room for Mr Wilmore and Ms Williams to join them in the vehicle to return to Earth at the end of its planned mission next February. A graphic showing the different parts of Boeing Starliner, including the hatches, 5-person crew set-up, and heat shield. Nasa has said both astronauts had previously completed two long-duration stays in space and understood the risks of the test flight, including being aboard the station longer than planned. The organisation said Mr Wilmore, 61, and Ms Williams, 58, both 'fully' supported the plans for their return and would spend the next few months carrying out scientific work, space maintenance and possibly doing some 'spacewalks'. Boeing's Starliner had already been delayed for several years because of setbacks in the spacecraft's development. Previous un-crewed flights also suffered technical problems. In a statement, Boeing said it continued to focus 'on the safety of the crew and spacecraft'.'We are executing the mission as determined by Nasa, and we are preparing for a safe and successful un-crewed return,' it added. Boeing's Starliner will come back to Earth empty, and the two astronauts who took it up into orbit on a test flight will return in a capsule built by a competing company, SpaceX. The long-awaited decision by NASA means the astronauts will have to cool their heels on the International Space Station until February. And it's a stunning blow to Boeing's beleaguered Starliner program, which has been beset by delays and technical troubles.'Space flight is risky, even at its safest and even at its most routine. And a test flight, by nature, is neither safe nor routine,' NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said at a press briefing on Saturday. He noted that the decision was made in the context of NASA officials knowing that past mistakes had resulted in the loss of two space shuttles and their crews. 'Our core value is safety and it is our North Star,' said Nelson.

This long-duration photo shows Boeing's Starliner docked to the International Space Station at night, with the Earth whizzing by below. NASA'This has not been an easy decision but it is absolutely the right one,' added NASA associate administrator Jim Free. In early June, astronauts Barry 'Butch' Wilmore and Sunita 'Suni' Williams blasted off in Starliner on a trip to the station that was supposed to last about eight days--but now it will be eight months. That's because glitches cropped up during the test flight. NASA and Boeing spent weeks trying to understand the cause of helium leaks and flakey behavior by thrusters that inexplicably conked out as Starliner approached the station.'It's been a long summer for our team,' said Steve Stich, the manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, who said that the situation with the thrusters was too complicated to know whether or not they might fail at a critical time. 'There was just too much uncertainty in the prediction of the thrusters.'So the agency has turned to their reliable partner SpaceX, which has successfully been providing taxi services to and from the station for several years. A SpaceX capsule was already scheduled to go to the station next month, with its return trip planned to occur in February. NASA has decided to reconfigure things so that this capsule has two seats free and available for Williams and Wilmore to catch a ride home.'That just became the easiest and the best option, and the most efficient option,' says Stich. And the two astronauts supported the agency's decision, though it means more time away from their loved ones back on Earth, says Norm Knight, director of flight operations at NASA. Both Williams and Wilmore are experienced astronauts who have done months-long stints on the International Space Station in the past. Having a rival firm step in to complete a high-profile, milestone mission is an embarrassing development for aerospace giant Boeing, which has long had difficulties with Starliner. In 2019, Starliner's first uncrewed test flight didn't even make it to the station. The second test flight, in 2022, was deemed a success, but engineers later found worrying problems such as the use of adhesive tape that was flammable. Fixing these issues delayed its first flight with astronauts. For a decade, Boeing and SpaceX both have had contracts with NASA as part of the agency's Commercial Crew Program, which was established to have industry provide regular flights to the nearby space station so that NASA would be freed up to focus on going to the moon and beyond. Boeing received significantly more money than SpaceX to develop a space taxi. But while Starliner has yet to complete a crewed round-trip flight to the ISS, SpaceX has done a number of crewed missions for NASA. In a statement on X, formerly called Twitter, Boeing said the company was continuing 'to focus, first and foremost, on the safety of the crew and spacecraft. We are executing the mission as determined by NASA, and we are preparing the spacecraft for a safe and successful uncrewed return.'Administrator Nelson said he'd talked to the CEO of Boeing, Kelly Ortberg, and that Ortberg said the company would continue to work to understand the problems once Starliner is back safely. NASA officials said they'd meet next week to discuss the return of Starliner, and that it may undock from the station and fly back to Earth early next month. NASA will return Boeing's Starliner to Earth without astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams aboard the spacecraft, the agency announced Saturday. The uncrewed return allows NASA and Boeing to continue gathering testing data on Starliner during its upcoming flight home, while also not accepting more risk than necessary for its crew. Wilmore and Williams, who flew to the International Space Station in June aboard NASA's Boeing Crew Flight Test, have been busy supporting station research, maintenance, and Starliner system testing and data analysis, among other activities.'Spaceflight is risky, even at its safest and most routine. A test flight, by nature, is neither safe, nor routine. The decision to keep Butch and Suni aboard the International Space Station and bring Boeing's Starliner home uncrewed is the result of our commitment to safety: our core value and our North Star,' said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. 'I'm grateful to both the NASA and Boeing teams for all their incredible and detailed work.'Wilmore and Williams will continue their work formally as part of the Expedition 71/72 crew through February 2025. They will fly home aboard a Dragon spacecraft with two other crew members assigned to the agency's SpaceX Crew-9 mission. Starliner is expected to depart from the space station and make a safe, controlled autonomous re-entry and landing in early September. NASA and Boeing identified helium leaks and experienced issues with the spacecraft reaction control thrusters on June 6 as Starliner approached the space station. Since then, engineering teams have completed a significant amount of work, including reviewing a collection of data, conducting flight and ground testing, hosting independent reviews with agency propulsion experts, and developing various return contingency plans. The uncertainty and lack of expert concurrence does not meet the agency's safety and performance requirements for human spaceflight, thus prompting NASA leadership to move the astronauts to the Crew-9 mission.'Decisions like this are never easy, but I want to commend our NASA and Boeing teams for their thorough analysis, transparent discussions, and focus on safety during the Crew Flight Test,' said Ken Bowersox, associate administrator for NASA's Space Operations Mission Directorate. 'We've learned a lot about the spacecraft during its journey to the station and its docked operations. We also will continue to gather more data about Starliner during the uncrewed return and improve the system for future flights to the space station.'Starliner is designed to operate autonomously and previously completed two uncrewed flights. NASA and Boeing will work together to adjust end-of-mission planning and Starliner's systems to set up for the uncrewed return in the coming weeks. Starliner must return to Earth before the Crew-9 mission launches to ensure a docking port is available on station.'Starliner is a very capable spacecraft and, ultimately, this comes down to needing a higher level of certainty to perform a crewed return,' said Steve Stich, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program. 'The NASA and Boeing teams have completed a tremendous amount of testing and analysis, and this flight test is providing critical information on Starliner's performance in space. Our efforts will help prepare for the uncrewed return and will greatly benefit future corrective actions for the spacecraft.'NASA's Commercial Crew Program requires spacecraft fly a crewed test flight to prove the system is ready for regular flights to and from the space station. Following Starliner's return, the agency will review all mission-related data to inform what additional actions are required to meet NASA's certification requirements. The agency's SpaceX Crew-9 mission, originally slated with four crew members, will launch no earlier than Tuesday, Sept. 24. The agency will share more information about the Crew-9 complement when details are finalized. NASA and SpaceX currently are working several items before launch, including reconfiguring seats on the Crew-9 Dragon, and adjusting the manifest to carry additional cargo, personal effects, and Dragon-specific spacesuits for Wilmore and Williams. In addition, NASA and SpaceX now will use new facilities at Space Launch Complex-40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida to launch Crew-9, which provides increased operational flexibility around NASA's planned Europa Clipper launch. The Crew-9 mission will be the ninth rotational mission to the space station under NASA's Commercial Crew Program, which works with the American aerospace industry to meet the goal of safe, reliable, and cost-effective transportation to and from the orbital outpost on American-made rockets and spacecraft launching from American soil. For more than two decades, people have lived and worked continuously aboard the International Space Station, advancing scientific knowledge and demonstrating new technologies, making research breakthroughs not possible on Earth. The station is a critical testbed for NASA to understand and overcome the challenges of long-duration spaceflight and to expand commercial opportunities in low Earth orbit. As commercial companies focus on providing human space transportation services and destinations as part of a robust low Earth orbit economy, NASA's Artemis campaign is underway at the Moon where the agency is preparing for future human exploration of Mars. NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams arrived at the orbiting laboratory on June 6 aboard the Boeing Starliner after lifting off on June 5 from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. During Starliner's flight to the space station, engineers noticed some of the spacecraft's thrusters did not perform as expected and several leaks in Starliner's helium system also were observed. Engineering teams at NASA and Boeing have since conducted several thruster tests and in-depth data reviews to better understand the spacecraft. While engineers work to resolve technical issues before Starliner's return to Earth, the astronaut duo have been working with the Expedition 71 crew, performing scientific research and maintenance activities. On Aug. 24, NASA decided Butch and Suni will remain aboard the space station instead of returning with the Starliner spacecraft. The agency's commitment to safety drove the decision, and it allows NASA and Boeing to continue gathering Starliner performance data during its early September return, while also not accepting more risk than necessary for its crew. Butch and Suni now will integrate into the Expedition 71/72 crew and will return to Earth in February 2025 with the agency's SpaceX Crew-9 mission. Here are some frequently asked questions about their mission. Boeing's Starliner spacecraft that launched NASA's Crew Flight Test astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the International Space Station is pictured docked to the Harmony module's forward port. This view is from a window on the SpaceX Dragon Endeavour spacecraft docked to the port adjacent to the Starliner. About the MissionWhat is NASA's Boeing Crew Flight Test? NASA's Boeing Crew Flight Test launched on June 5, and is the first flight of the Starliner spacecraft to the International Space Station with astronauts. The flight test aims to prove the system is ready for rotational missions to the space station. NASA wants two American spacecraft, in addition to the Roscosmos Soyuz spacecraft, capable of carrying astronauts to help ensure a permanent crew aboard the orbiting complex. What are the goals of the Crew Flight Test? This flight test's goal is to demonstrate Starliner's ability to execute a six-month rotational mission to the space station. The test objectives were developed to support NASA's certification process and gather the performance data needed to evaluate readiness ahead of long-duration flights. What happened to Starliner? During Starliner's flight to the space station, some of the spacecraft's thrusters did not perform as expected and several leaks in Starliner's helium system were observed. Since then, NASA and Boeing have taken additional time to learn more about the spacecraft through in-flight and ground testing and extensive data analysis before making the best, safest decision on how and when to return the crew home. This analysis included processes and organizations established as a result of the space shuttle Columbia accident. Why did NASA decide to return Starliner without astronauts aboard the spacecraft? NASA made the decision following in-depth technical reviews covering Starliner's propulsion and helium systems and expected performance during return scenarios. Given the uncertainty around Starliner's systems and NASA's high performance and safety standards for human spaceflight, the agency could not accept more risk than necessary for Butch and Suni's return. NASA now is replanning its SpaceX Crew-9 mission by launching two crew members in late September instead of four. Butch and Suni will return to Earth after the regularly scheduled Crew-9 increment early next year. Can Starliner fly without astronauts? Yes, Starliner can undock and deorbit autonomously. Starliner undocked and returned on its own during Orbital Flight Test-2 in 2022, and it also performed a full entry and landing autonomously during the first Orbital Flight Test in 2019. What now happens with Starliner? NASA and Boeing will begin preparations for a Starliner return in early September without crew. During its return, the NASA-Boeing team will monitor the flight and collect additional performance data to improve the spacecraft for future flights. Will Starliner be certified for future flights to the space station? NASA's Commercial Crew Program will carefully review all Starliner data collected during the mission to determine whether the system is ready for regular flights to and from the space station. If needed, the agency will also determine what additional elements may be required to meet NASA's certification requirements. If there's an emergency aboard the space station, how will Butch and Suni get home? The International Space Station crew and ground teams have completed the configuration of the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft supportingCrew-8 to now serve as the emergency return spacecraft for Butch and Suni, if needed, until NASA's SpaceX Crew-9 mission arrives following its launch no earlier than Tuesday, Sept. 24. Did NASA always plan to use SpaceX as a backup to bring Butch and Suni back? The main goal of the agency's Commercial Crew Program is two, unique human spaceflight systems. Should any one system encounter an issue, NASA still has the capability to launch and return crew to ensure safety and a continuous human presence aboard the International Space Station.

Dyson (far right), both NASA astronauts, in their spacesuits aboard the International Space Station's Quest airlock. About the AstronautsAre Butch and Suni stuck aboard the space station? No, Butch and Suni are safe aboard the space station working alongside the Expedition 71 crew conducting research and performing station maintenance. They also have been actively involved in Starliner testing and technical meetings. How long will Butch and Suni stay aboard the space station? Butch and Suni will remain aboard the station until late-February 2025. NASA is replanning the agency's SpaceX Crew-9 mission and will launch only two crew members instead of four in late September. Butch and Suni will return to Earth after the regularly scheduled Crew-9 increment. Are Suni and Butch prepared for a longer stay? Butch and Suni each have previously completed two long-duration stays aboard the station. NASA astronauts embark on missions fully aware of the various scenarios that may become reality. This mission is no different, and they understood the possibilities and unknowns, including being aboard station longer than planned. Are Butch and Suni alone aboard the space station? No. Butch and Suni have integrated with the Expedition 71 crew, which consists of NASA astronauts Matthew Dominick, Mike Barratt, Jeanette Epps, and Tracy C. Dyson, as well as Roscosmos cosmonauts Oleg Kononenko, Nikolai Chub, and Alexander Grebenkin. How does Butch and Suni's extended stay compare to other space station mission lengths? A typical stay aboard the International Space Station is about six months, and NASA astronauts also have remained aboard the space station for longer duration missions. Previous missions have given NASA volumes of data about long-duration spaceflight and its effects on the human body, which the agency applies to any crewed mission. Do the astronauts have what they need (e.g., food, clothing, oxygen, personal items, etc.)? Yes. The space station is well-stocked with everything the crew needs, including food, water, clothing, and oxygen. Additionally, NASA and its space station partners frequently launch resupply missions carrying additional supplies and cargo. In August, a Northrop Grumman Cygnus spacecraft carrying 8,200 pounds of food, fuel, supplies, and science and a Progress resupply spacecraft carrying three tons of cargo arrived at the station. NASA has additional resupply missions planned through the end of 2024 and beyond. What are they doing aboard the space station? NASA is taking advantage of Butch and Suni's extra time aboard the orbital laboratory, where they have been busy supporting station research, maintenance, and Starliner system testing and data analysis, among other activities. Some of the science they've recently completed includes new ways to produce fiber optic cables and growing plants aboard the orbiting complex. Can they talk to their family and friends? Butch and Suni enjoy many of the same comforts we have here on Earth. They can email, call, and video conference with their family and friends when they have 'free time' aboard the International Space Station. Boeing launched astronauts for the first time Wednesday, belatedly joining SpaceX as a second taxi service for NASA. A pair of NASA test pilots blasted off aboard Boeing's Starliner capsule for the International Space Station, the first to fly the new spacecraft. The trip by Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams was expected to take 25 hours, with an arrival Thursday. They will spend just over a week at the orbiting lab before climbing back into Starliner for a remote desert touchdown in the western U. S. on June 14.'Let's get going!' Wilmore called out a few minutes before liftoff. Half an hour later, he and Williams were safely in orbit and giving chase to the space station. Back at Cape Canaveral, the relieved launch controllers stood and applauded. After all the trouble leading up to Wednesday's launch, including two scrapped countdowns, everything went smoothly before and during liftoff, prompting congratulations from SpaceX's Elon Musk and others.'Today it all lined up,' said Boeing program manager Mark Nappi. Years late because of spacecraft flaws, Starliner's crew debut comes as the company struggles with unrelated safety issues on its airplane side. After years of delays and stumbles, Boeing is finally poised to launch astronauts to the International Space Station for NASA. It's the first flight of Boeing's Starliner capsule with a crew on board, a pair of NASA pilots who will check out the spacecraft during the test drive and a weeklong stay at the space station. NASA turned to U. S. companies for astronaut rides after the space shuttles were retired. Elon Musk's SpaceX has made nine taxi trips for NASA since 2020, while Boeing has managed only a pair of unoccupied test flights. Boeing program manager Mark Nappi wishes Starliner was further along. 'There's no doubt about that, but we're here now.'The company's long-awaited astronaut demo is slated for liftoff Monday night. Provided this tryout goes well, NASA will alternate between Boeing and SpaceX to get astronauts to and from the space station. A look at the newest ride and its shakedown cruise: White with black and blue trim, Boeing's Starliner capsule is about 10 feet (3 meters) tall and 15 feet (4.5 meters) in diameter. It can fit up to seven people, though NASA crews typically will number four. The company settled on the name Starliner nearly a decade ago, a twist on the name of Boeing's early Stratoliner and the current Dreamliner. No one was aboard Boeing's two previous Starliner test flights. The first, in 2019, was hit with software trouble so severe that its empty capsule couldn't reach the station until the second try in 2022. Then last summer, weak parachutes and flammable tape cropped up that needed to be fixed or removed.",426,Medium,5362,"[{'version': 'Human', 'Compression Ratio': 0.07990690460000001}, {'version':

The astronauts, Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore, took off on what was planned to be an eight-day mission on 5 June but will now spend around eight months in orbit. The Boeing Starliner spacecraft the astronauts travelled to International Space Station (ISS) on will return to Earth ""un-crewed"". The pair experienced problems on their way to the ISS, including leaks of helium, which pushes fuel into the propulsion system. Several thrusters also did not work properly. Boeing and SpaceX were both awarded billion-dollar contracts by Nasa to provide commercial space flights for its astronauts. Boeing's contract was worth $4.2bn (£3.18bn) while SpaceX, which was founded by billionaire Elon Musk, got $2.6bn. SpaceX has so far sent nine crewed flights to space for Nasa, as well as some commercial missions, but this was Boeing's first attempt at a crewed mission. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said, ""This time, [the decision] has not been an easy decision, but it is absolutely the right one."" He added, ""Lessons learned from NASA's two space shuttle accidents played a role."" The astronauts, who are both retired Navy captains with previous long-duration spaceflight experience, have been in space since the beginning of June. During their lone orbital news conference last month, the astronauts said they had trust in the thruster testing being conducted. They had no complaints, they added, and enjoyed pitching in with space station work. NASA is yanking two astronauts to make room for Williams and Wilmore on the return flight in late February. NASA said no serious consideration was given to asking SpaceX for a quick stand-alone rescue. Last year, the Russian Space Agency had to rush up a replacement Soyuz capsule for three men whose original craft was damaged by space junk. The switch pushed their six-month mission to just over a year. ","NASA has announced that two astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who have been stranded in space for over two months, will return to Earth in February 2025 aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft. The decision was made due to the ongoing issues with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, which was initially intended to bring the astronauts back to Earth. The astronauts, who took off on an eight-day mission on June 5, will now spend around eight months in orbit. The SpaceX capsule currently parked at the space station is reserved for the four residents who have been there since March. They will return in late September, their routine six-month stay extended a month by the Starliner dilemma. NASA and SpaceX are currently working on several items before launch, including reconfiguring seats on the Dragon and adjusting the manifest to carry additional cargo, personal effects, and Dragon-specific spacesuits for Wilmore and Williams. In addition, NASA and SpaceX will use new facilities at Space Launch Complex-40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida to launch Crew-9, which provides increased operational flexibility around NASA's planned Europa Clipper launch. The agency's commitment to safety drove the decision, and it allows NASA and Boeing to continue gathering Starliner performance data during its early September return, while also not accepting more risk than necessary for its crew. Butch and Suni will integrate into the Expedition 71/72 crew and will return to Earth in February 2025 with the agency's SpaceX Crew-9 mission. NASA is extending U.S. media accreditation for the launch of the agency's ninth rotational mission, which is targeted for no earlier than Tuesday, Sept. 24. Media members who have already applied do not need to reapply. "
2022-06-03,Scientists discover seagrass off Australia is world's largest plant,https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Scientists_discover_seagrass_off_Australia_is_world%27s_largest_plant,Science & Environment,"Scientists at the University of Western Australia published a study Wednesday suggesting that a seagrass off the coast of Western Australia is the world's largest plant. The Posidonia australis is thought to have begun to clone itself 4,500 years ago, and covers about 200 square kilometres (77 square miles). It is located in Shark Bay, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Western Australia. Shark Bay was submerged relatively recently, within the past 8,500 years. The scientists discovered the plant was a single organism after taking 18,000 separate genetic markers to examine the seagrass to find samples to use in restoration projects. However, they discovered the same plant had cloned itself many times instead. Dr Martin Breed, an ecologist at Flinders University, said We thought 'what the hell is going on here?... We were completely stumped'. Jane Edgeloe, one of the co-authors of the research, said the DNA of the samples was compared and it was discovered from this that the seagrass meadow was a single plant. The plant is around three times the size of Manhattan, and measures at least 180 kilometres (112 miles) in length. As well as being the world's largest known plant, it is the world's largest known clone. The seagrass greatly surpasses the 43-hectare stand of quaking Aspen trees in Utah, United States, previously thought to be the world's largest plant. The seagrass grows a maximum of 35 centimetres per year, with its large size helping scientists calculate its age. Dr. Elizabeth Sinclair, another co-author of the study, said the plant's survival was helped by it holding onto all the chromosomes from both its parents. This gave it genetic diversity, which is unusual among plants that produce asexually. The plant does not sexually reproduce; however, subtle variations in its DNA may help explain its longevity. Associate Professor Kathryn McMahon, of Edith Cowan University, was not involved in the study but is an expert on seagrass. She said seagrass tends to live for between 2,000 and 100,000 years, meaning the plant's age of about 4,500 years fits into the normal age range of seagrass. McMahon also said she was confident in the method used by the researchers, and that the finding it was a single plant was amazing. Despite the plant's vast size, in the past ten years, almost a tenth of it has been destroyed by cyclones and rising ocean temperatures, which NBC News noted had been attributed to climate change. The bay has relatively high salinity and its temperatures vary from as cold as 15C (59F) to as hot as 30C (86F).","['https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/01/what-the-hell-australian-scientists-discover-biggest-plant-on-earth-off-wa-coast',

from two different seagrass species – found itself nestled in a favourable spot somewhere in what is now known as Shark Bay, just off Australia's west coast. Left to its own devices and relatively undisturbed by human hands, scientists have discovered that seed has grown to what is now believed to be the biggest plant anywhere on Earth, covering about 200 sq km (77 sq miles, or about 20,000 rugby fields, or just over three times the size of Manhattan island). The species – a Posidonia australis, also known as fibre-ball weed or ribbon weed – is commonly found along the southern coastlines of Australia. But when scientists started looking for genetic differences in ribbon weed across the bay, they came across a puzzle. Samples taken from sites that were 180km apart suggested there were not multiple specimens of Posidonia australis, but one single plant. 'We thought 'what the hell is going on here?'' said Dr Martin Breed, an ecologist at Flinders University.'We were completely stumped.' Student researcher Jane Edgeloe, of the University of Western Australia (UWA), said about 18,000 genetic markers were examined as they looked for variations in the species that might help them select specimens for use in restoration projects. But what they found instead was that the same plant had spread using rhizomes in the same way that a lawn can spread from its edges by sending out runners. 'The existing 200 sq km of ribbon weed meadows appear to have expanded from a single, colonising seedling,' she said. The one plant now spreads out like a meadow, providing habitat for a huge array of marine species including turtles, dolphins, dugongs, crabs and fish. Ribbon weed rhizomes can grow up to 35cm a year and, using that rate, the authors of the research – published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B – estimate the plant will have needed at least 4,500 years to spread as far as it has. Dr Elizabeth Sinclair, a co-author of the research at UWA, said they hadn't given the plant a nickname, and original samples – pulled from the seagrass meadow – originally had 116 different labels with GPS coordinates when they were stored in a deep freeze ready for genetic sampling. The plant has formed huge, dense meadows that in some areas stretch as far as the eye can see in all directions. The ribbons of the plant are only 10cm long in some places, but up to a metre in others. Conditions in Shark Bay itself are challenging. The plant has found a way to survive in areas where the salinity is double that elsewhere in the bay, and can thrive in water temperatures as cold as 15C and as hot as 30C. The seagrass plant's survival appears to be linked, Sinclair said, to how it had held on to all the chromosomes from its two parents, giving it inbuilt genetic diversity.'Instead of getting half [of] its genes from mum and half from dad, it's kept all of them,' she said. Sinclair and colleagues are still working through the secrets of the giant specimen, but she said it appears to be 'largely sterile' and so has to rely on its own ability to grow, rather than disperse seeds. Breed said the fact the plant 'doesn't have sex' but had survived for so long was a puzzle. 'Plants that don't have sex tend to also have reduced genetic diversity, which they normally need when dealing with environmental change,' he said. Breed said they had detected some very subtle mutations in the plant's genetics across the places it was growing that might also explain its extreme longevity. The size of the Shark Bay ribbon weed is about 20,000 hectares (49,000 acres) – making it much larger than a stand of quaking Aspen trees in Utah, often referred to as the world's largest plant, covering 43 hectares. Associate professor Kathryn McMahon, of Edith Cowan University, was not involved in the Shark Bay research but is an expert on seagrass. She said the method used by the researchers gave her confidence they had identified one single specimen, which she said was 'amazing'. Genetic studies of other seagrass species had estimated the plants could live for between 2,000 and 100,000 years, so McMahon said the estimate that the Shark Bay specimen was 4,500 years old fits into that range. 'They have a versatile growth pattern which contributes to this long life span,' she said.'They can grow towards nutrient-rich patches to access the nutrient they need, or to gaps in the meadow where there is space for them to grow or away from stressful locations. 'All of these characteristics mean that if they are in the right place they can persist over long periods of time.'Scientists have discovered the world's largest plant off the Australia coast — a seagrass meadow that has grown by repeatedly cloning itself. Genetic analysis has revealed that the underwater fields of waving green seagrass are a single organism covering 70 square miles (180 square kilometers) through making copies of itself over 4,500 years. The research was published Wednesday in Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Scientists confirmed that the meadow was a single organism by sampling and comparing the DNA of seagrass shoots across the bed, wrote Jane Edgeloe, a study co-author and marine biologist at the University of Western Australia. A variety of plants and some animals can reproduce asexually. There are disadvantages to being clones of a single organism — such as increased susceptibility to diseases — but 'the process can create 'hopeful monsters'' by enabling rapid growth, the researchers wrote. The scientists call the meadow of Poseidon's ribbon weed 'the most widespread known clone on Earth,' covering an area larger than Washington. Though the seagrass meadow is immense, it's vulnerable. A decade ago, the seagrass covered an additional seven square miles, but cyclones and rising ocean temperatures linked to climate change have recently killed almost a tenth of the ancient seagrass bed. Polyploidy has the potential to allow organisms to outcompete their diploid progenitor(s) and occupy new environments. Shark Bay, Western Australia, is a World Heritage Area dominated by temperate seagrass meadows including Poseidon's ribbon weed, Posidonia australis.",443,Medium,1060,"[{'version': 'Human', 'Compression Ratio': 0.4101825168}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Compression Ratio': 0.3150816523}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Compression Ratio': 0.3102785783}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Novel N-gram %': 44.776119403}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Novel N-gram %': 27.2727272727}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Novel N-gram %': 12.6666666667}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Flesch Reading Ease': 53.8481889149, 'Flesch-Kincaid Grade': 10.7999531616, 'Gunning Fog': 13.8476190476, 'SMOG Index': 13.2567166989}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Flesch Reading Ease': 39.3660131332, 'Flesch-Kincaid Grade': 14.0365853659, 'Gunning Fog': 17.409380863, 'SMOG Index': 15.4020477369}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Flesch Reading Ease': 49.6025090299, 'Flesch-Kincaid Grade': 13.027623839, 'Gunning Fog': 15.8440660475, 'SMOG Index': 13.6886701854}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Distinct-1': 0.7882352941, 'Distinct-2': 0.968503937}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Distinct-1': 0.8461538462, 'Distinct-2': 0.9896907216}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Distinct-1': 0.8474576271, 'Distinct-2': 0.9943181818000001}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'TP': 27, 'FP': 181, 'FN': 14, 'Keyword Precision': 0.1298076923, 'Keyword Recall': 0.6585365854, 'Keyword F1': 0.2168674699, 'Keywords Found': '000, 500, australia, australis, bay, breed, genetic, known, meadow, miles, organism, plant, plants, posidonia, research, said, scientists, seagrass, shark, sinclair, single, size, square, university, western, world, years', 'Keywords Missing': 'covering, grow, long, meadows, puzzle, ribbon, royal, sex, society, species, specimen, specimens, spread, weed'}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'TP': 32, 'FP': 138, 'FN': 9, 'Keyword Precision': 0.1882352941, 'Keyword Recall': 0.7804878049, 'Keyword F1': 0.3033175355, 'Keywords Found': '500, australia, australis, bay, covering, genetic, grow, known, long, meadow, miles, organism, plant, plants, posidonia, ribbon, royal, said, seagrass, shark, single, size, society, species, specimen, spread, square, university, weed, western, world, years', 'Keywords Missing': '000, breed, meadows, puzzle, research, scientists, sex, sinclair, specimens'}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'TP': 30, 'FP': 131, 'FN': 11, 'Keyword Precision': 0.1863354037, 'Keyword Recall': 0.7317073171, 'Keyword F1': 0.29702970300000003, 'Keywords Found': '500, australia, australis, bay, covering, genetic, known, long, meadow, meadows, miles, organism, plant, plants, posidonia, puzzle, research, ribbon, royal, seagrass, sex, shark, single, society, species, square, weed, western, world, years', 'Keywords Missing': '000, breed, grow, said, scientists, sinclair, size, specimen, specimens, spread, university'}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Jaccard Similarity (vs Human)': 1.0}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Jaccard Similarity (vs Human)': 0.2119205298}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Jaccard Similarity (vs Human)': 0.16611295680000002}]","[{'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'ROUGE-1 F1 (vs Human)': 0.5538461538, 'ROUGE-2 F1 (vs Human)': 0.2210796915, 'ROUGE-L F1 (vs Human)': 0.25384615380000003}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'ROUGE-1 F1 (vs Human)': 0.48900388100000003, 'ROUGE-2 F1 (vs Human)': 0.20492866410000002, 'ROUGE-L F1 (vs Human)': 0.22250970250000002}]","[{'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'BERTScore P (vs Human)': 0.9655108452000001, 'BERTScore R (vs Human)': 0.9641313553, 'BERTScore F1 (vs Human)': 0.9648206234000001}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'BERTScore P (vs Human)': 0.9618343115, 'BERTScore R (vs Human)': 0.9600468278000001, 'BERTScore F1 (vs Human)': 0.9609397054000001}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Q2 Model Output': '1', 'Q2_score': 1}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Q2 Model Output': '1', 'Q2_score': 1}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Q2 Model Output': '1', 'Q2_score': 1}]","[{'Human_vs_Plain_winner': 'Plain LLM', 'Plain_vs_Human_winner': 'Plain LLM', 'Human_vs_RAG_winner': 'RAG LLM', 'RAG_vs_Human_winner': 'RAG LLM', 'RAG_vs_Plain_winner': 'RAG LLM', 'Plain_vs_RAG_winner': 'Plain LLM'}, {'Human_vs_Plain_confidence_score': 4, 'Plain_vs_Human_confidence_score': 4, 'Human_vs_RAG_confidence_score': 4, 'RAG_vs_Human_confidence_score': 4, 'RAG_vs_Plain_confidence_score': 4, 'Plain_vs_RAG_confidence_score': 4}, {'Human_vs_Plain_reasoning_text': ""Article 2 presents a more comprehensive and detailed account of the discovery, including the method used to confirm the plant was a single organism and the implications of its clonal growth.

2021-04-23,European Union to reduce carbon emissions by 55% of 1990 levels by 2030,https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/European_Union_to_reduce_carbon_emissions_by_55%25_of_1990_levels_by_2030/,Politics & Policy,"On Wednesday, the European Union (EU) set a new goal to cut carbon emissions by at least 55% from 1990 levels by 2030 and reach zero net emissions by 2050, increasing the reduction target set in 2014, which was 40% by 2030 and 80-95% by 2050.The EU Climate Law, agreed after 14 hours of negotiations includes the establishment of a 15-member independent body to advise on proposed climate policies and increased investment in 'carbon sinks'. According to members of the European Parliament (MEP) those will ensure 57% net reduction target is in place. This claim has been disputed by senior policy officer for climate and energy at the European Environmental Bureau Barbara Mariani, who says the measures equal a 52.8% cut in actual emissions.A September 2020 press release by the European Commission (EC) promised 'following broad public consultation and thorough impact assessments, the Commission will come forward with the corresponding legislative proposals by June 2021', including, according to the BBC News a limit on CO2 removal that counts toward the target, encouraging member states to actually reduce carbon emissions instead of merely removing them. 'Adopting the new target in time would allow the EU to communicate its higher ambition to international partners well ahead of the 2021 UN Climate Conference (COP26) in Glasgow and set the bar for others to follow', the press release read.This decision means the EU is to spend at least 30% of its €1.8 trillion long-term budget on the concerns related to the climate. Poland has adopted its own climate strategy. According to Reuters, Poland is the only EU member state to refuse a pledge to climate neutrality, instead aiming to reduce emissions by 30% by 2030. The country relies on coal for 80% of its electricity, but will move towards renewable energy and its first nuclear power plant, Reuters reported.The EC president Ursula von der Leyen said the decision leads 'the EU on a green path for a generation'. Criticising this decision, MEP Michael Bloss said, '[w]e fought hard but achieved little', as well as saying the law was a 'big disappointment.' Director of Climate Action Network Europe Wendel Trio said '[t]he 'at least 55% emission reduction target for 2030' is not in line with the Paris Agreement's ambition to limit temperature rise to 1.5C by the end of the century', adding the law was 'rushed' and 'not the kind of climate law that will help the EU to lead the global efforts to tackle climate change'.MEP and chair of the European Parliament's environmental committee Pascal Canfin said 'it was not possible' to convince the member states 'to change the wording 'at least 55 net'', and while 'parliament was obviously ready to go even further', he said 'the compromise found is ambitious: we are going to do two and a half times more in nine years than what we have done in the last 10 years in Europe.'According to The Guardian under current measures the EU is expected to reduce emissions by 46% by 2030. The EC's press release said between 1990 and 2019, green house gas emissions fell by a quarter.Per multiple reports, the United Kingdom set its target to 78% by 2035.","['https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-56828383/', 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/21/new-eu-target-to-cut-carbon-emissions-by-at-least-55-disappoints-experts/',

make them legally binding. Under a new law agreed between member states and the EU Parliament, the bloc will cut carbon emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. The EU parliament had pushed for a higher target of a 60% reduction.'Our political commitment to becoming the first climate neutral continent by 2050 is now also a legal one,' said EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen.'The Climate Law sets the EU on a green path for a generation.'The deal comes ahead of a virtual summit of world leaders later this week, where the US is expected to announce its own climate targets for 2030. US President Joe Biden, who will lead the meeting, rejoined the Paris climate agreement in his first day in office and has previously committed to reaching net zero emissions by 2050. The UK, meanwhile, announced radical plans to cut carbon emissions by 78% by 2035 earlier this week, although environmentalists warn that the government has consistently failed to achieve previous targets set by its independent Climate Change Committee (CCC). The EU Climate Law was agreed in the early hours of Wednesday after months of talks. It sets a limit on the levels of CO2 removal that can count towards the 2030 target, to ensure that states actively lower emissions rather than removing them from the atmosphere through forests, for example. A 15-member independent council will also be established to advise the EU on climate measures and targets. The EU Commission will announce a package of climate laws in June to support the plans. The target to reduce emissions by 55% by 2030 was initially announced by EU leaders in December but there had been pressure from the EU Parliament and environmental groups for the law to go even further. Previous EU targets had called for a 40% cut. EU Commission Vice-President Frans Timmerman described the agreement as 'a landmark moment for the EU and a strong signal to the world'. However, Greens MEP Michael Bloss tweeted that the climate law was a 'big disappointment', adding: 'We fought hard but achieved little'. In September the EU Commission set out its blueprint, external for reaching the 55% target by 2030, and said at least 30% of the EU's €1.8tn (£1.64tn; $2.2tn) long-term budget would be spent on climate-related measures. The targets are part of a global effort to tackle climate change by cutting atmospheric pollution, especially carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The Paris climate deal, signed in 2016, aims to keep global temperature rise well under 2C, and preferably within a maximum rise of 1.5C, to prevent the worst effects of climate change. A new EU target of a 55% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 has been described as a 'farce' by environmental groups after it was agreed in Brussels on the eve of Joe Biden's climate summit for world leaders. After 14 hours of intensive negotiations, representatives of the EU's member states and parliament emerged on Wednesday morning to announce a deal in principle on cuts and the establishment of a new independent body of scientists to monitor the policy. The development, said by the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, to 'put the EU on a green path for a generation', envisages a reduction of at least 55% in net greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared with 1990 levels, and zero net emissions by 2050. The 2030 reduction target had previously been set at 40%. It has also been agreed that the EU will invest further in 'carbon sinks' such as forests, grasslands and wetlands. MEPs involved in the talks claimed this would in effect equate to a 57% net reduction target for member states. However, environmental groups were quick out of the blocks in criticising the deal. The agreement fails to tie up all member states to zero emissions by 2050 as a consequence of Poland opting out of a provisional leaders' agreement on the target last December. Poland relies on coal for 80% of the country's electricity. MEPs, who had sought a 60% cut by 2030, also failed to significantly raise the ambitions of the EU's capitals despite the claims on Wednesday that the bloc was showing global leadership on the climate emergency. Earlier this week, the UK government said it would toughen its targets on greenhouse gas emissions for the next 15 years, the first major developed economy to do so. Following recommendations of the government's statutory climate advisers, carbon dioxide is to be cut in the UK by 78% by 2035 compared with 1990 levelsWendel Trio, the director of Climate Action Network (CAN) Europe, an alliance of environmental NGOs, said: 'The 'at least 55% emission reduction target for 2030' is not in line with the Paris agreement's ambition to limit temperature rise to 1.5C by the end of the century.'Trio said the target had been 'rushed by EU lawmakers to bring something to the leaders' summit organised by the US'. 'This is definitely not the kind of climate law that will help the EU to lead the global efforts to tackle climate change,' he said. Biden, whose first act as president was to reinstate the US to the Paris climate agreement, will chair a virtual summit of 40 world leaders on Thursday. It is being seen as a key milestone on the road to the UN climate Change conference (Cop26) this November in Glasgow where leaders will underscore the need to limit planetary warming to 1.5C by the end of the century. Barbara Mariani, senior policy officer for climate and energy with the European Environmental Bureau (EEB), said the target translated to only a 52.8% cut in actual emissions from polluting sectors as the larger figure took into account emissions that could potentially be absorbed. Under current measures the EU already expects to reduce emissions by 46% of 2030.'Today's agreement is not a victory for climate action, it's a farce,' Mariani said. 'We are also baffled to see that the council [of member states] rejected a proposal to extend the EU's climate neutrality target to all member states, which risks triggering lack of accountability at national level and creating a two-speed Europe in which some countries will inevitably lag behind.'Pascal Canfin, the Renew Europe MEP, who chairs the European parliament's environment committee, said it had proved 'impossible' to move the 27 member states from the headline target of a reduction of 55% following agreement at a summit last December, but that commitments on investment in carbon sinks were a significant win.'There was definitely no space to change the wording 'at least 55 net,' he said. 'We tried, I don't know how many times, but it was not possible … parliament was obviously ready to go even further, but the compromise found is ambitious: we are going to do two and a half times more in nine years than what we have done in the last 10 years in Europe.' The deal will now be fine-tuned by lawyers ahead of formal adoption by the institutions. Radical new climate change commitments will set the UK on course to cut carbon emissions by 78% by 2035, the UK government has announced. Hitting the targets would require more electric cars, low-carbon heating, renewable electricity and, for many, cutting down on meat and dairy. For the first time, climate law will be extended to cover international aviation and shipping. But Labour said the government had to match 'rhetoric with reality'. It urged Boris Johnson to treat 'the climate emergency as the emergency it is' and show 'greater ambition'. The prime minister's commitments, which are to become law, bring forward the current target for reducing carbon emissions by 15 years. This would be a world-leading position. Homes will need to be much better insulated, and people will be encouraged to drive less and walk and cycle more. Aviation is likely to become more expensive for frequent fliers. The government has accepted the advice of its independent Climate Change Committee (CCC) to adopt the emissions cut, which is based on 1990 levels. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has predicted a major surge in CO2 emissions from energy this year, as the world rebounds from the pandemic. The UK's new commitments come as US President Joe Biden prepares to stage a climate summit from Washington DC. Environmentalists welcomed the government's move, but warned that ministers had consistently failed to achieve previous CCC-set targets. And they insisted that Chancellor Rishi Sunak must show clearly how the transition is to be funded. Tom Burke, who chairs the environmental think tank E3G, explained what policy changes were needed to achieve the goal: 'The most important thing, I think, is for [the prime minister] to focus his policy around energy efficiency, around wind and solar, and around storage of electricity and the management of the grid,' he said. However, he told the BBC's Today programme: 'At the moment, it's... a bit of a Boris blunderbuss and is a huge range of marginal things instead of a concentration of effort on those things that will deliver the most emissions reductions in the fastest time.'Leo Murray of the climate charity Possible called the announcement 'fantastic', but added: 'We're not on track to meet previous climate commitments and in many ways the government is still failing.'Mr Murray said ministers were 'facing both directions at the same time', as they had scrapped the Green Homes Grant for insulating homes, had not stopped airport expansion and were 'still pushing a £27bn roads budget'. The CCC report accepted by the government says low-carbon investment must scale up to £50bn a year in the UK. But it adds that in time fuel savings from more efficient equipment will cancel out investment costs. The CCC believes around 1% of GDP - national wealth - would need to be spent on shifting away from fossil fuels over 30 years. Its chairman, Lord Deben, said previously: 'The implication of this path is clear: the utmost focus is required from government over the next 10 years.'If policy is not scaled up across every sector, if business is not encouraged to invest, if the people of the UK are not engaged in this challenge - the UK will not deliver net zero by 2050. The 2020s must be the decisive decade of progress and action.'Ed Matthew, campaigns director of E3G, said: 'Setting an ambitious emission reduction target would boost the UK's diplomatic drive to persuade other countries to set out ambitious targets of their own.'He added: 'The UK now has the opportunity to spark a global green industrial revolution, but ultimately its credibility will rest on action.'Net zero means cutting emissions as far as possible, then balancing out any remaining releases by, for example, tree planting. The government has adopted the new 2035 deadline for a 78% emissions cut because scientists say this is needed to keep the rise in global temperatures close to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. For Labour, shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said: 'The character of this government on climate change is now clear: targets without delivery.'So while any strengthening of our targets is the right thing to do, the government can't be trusted to match rhetoric with reality.'He added: 'We need a government that treats the climate emergency as the emergency it is. That means greater ambition than this government matched with much more decisive action.'Green Party MP Caroline Lucas commented: 'The most glaring problem [with the plan] is the government's failure to address what's driving the climate crisis: an outdated and exploitative economic system that treats our planet and natural world as peripheral to our lives and, worse, expendable.'The Prime Minister needs to accompany stronger climate targets with an economic reset to put the health and well-being of people and planet above short-term profit and growth.'Poland on Tuesday adopted an energy strategy to 2040, which the climate minister said would provide a compass as the country seeks to navigate away from coal. The document has been subject to numerous changes and delays as the government sought to align it with European Union climate policies and fend off opposition from powerful coal unions. But rising carbon emission costs and the impact of COVID-19 have forced the government to focus on strategic allocation of state funds to kickstart the economy. The government's energy policy goals include developing renewable energy sources and nuclear power, although it said it would seek to use its own energy resources, chiefly coal, as long as possible. Under the plan, the share of renewable energy in final energy consumption will rise to at least 23% by 2030, when the country's offshore wind capacity is seen at 5.9 gigawatts (GW) compared to zero now. The government also pledged to start a first nuclear plant with capacity of 1.0-1.6 GW. Poland gets the bulk of its electricity from carbon-intensive coal and it is the only EU state that has refused to pledge climate neutrality by 2050, saying it needs more time and money to complete the shift to zero emissions. Instead, the government says Poland will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% in 2030. Poland's Climate Minister Michal Kurtyka said on Twitter: '2040 will be our compass in the transition to a zero-carbon economy'. Environmental campaigners said that the government's strategy was inadequate and to prevent further temperature rises, the EU and Poland should stop burning coal before 2030.'It seems that Minister Kurtyka - although he is responsible for the Ministry of Climate - has forgotten about the droughts, floods or hurricane winds that affect us more and more often due to climate change. The project is also detached from the realities of European politics,' Joanna Flisowska, head of climate and energy at Greenpeace Polska, said. A reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 40% below the 1990 level, an EU-wide binding target for renewable energy of at least 27%, renewed ambitions for energy efficiency policies, a new governance system and a set of new indicators to ensure a competitive and secure energy system. These are the pillars of the new EU framework on climate and energy for 2030 presented today by the European Commission. Supported by a detailed analysis on energy prices and costs, the 2030 framework will ensure regulatory certainty for investors and a coordinated approach among Member States, leading to the development of new technologies. The framework aims to drive continued progress towards a low-carbon economy and a competitive and secure energy system that ensures affordable energy for all consumers, increases the security of the EU's energy supplies, reduces our dependence on energy imports and creates new opportunities for growth and jobs, by taking into account potential price impacts on the longer term. The Communication setting out the 2030 framework will be debated at the highest level, in particular in the European Council and European Parliament. It is accompanied by a legislative proposal for a market stability reserve for the EU emissions trading system (EU ETS) starting in 2021, to improve its robustness. A report on energy prices and costs in Europe, published alongside the Communication, suggests that the rising energy prices can be partly mitigated by ensuring cost effective energy and climate policies, competitive energy markets and improved energy efficiency. European Commission President José Manuel Barroso said: 'Climate action is central for the future of our planet, while a truly European energy policy is key for our competitiveness. Today's package proves that tackling the two issues simultaneously is not contradictory, but mutually reinforcing. It is in the EU's interest to build a job-rich economy that is less dependent on imported energy through increased efficiency and greater reliance on domestically produced clean energy. An ambitious 40% greenhouse reduction target for 2030 is the most cost-effective milestone in our path towards a low-carbon economy. And the renewables target of at least 27% is an important signal: to give stability to investors, boost green jobs and support our security of supply'. Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger said: 'The 2030 framework is the EU's drive for progress towards a competitive low-carbon economy, investment stability and security of energy supply. My aim is to make sure that energy remains affordable for households and companies. The 2030 framework sets a high level of ambition for action against climate change, but it also recognises that this needs to be achieved at least cost. The internal energy market provides the basis to achieve this goal and I will continue to work on its completion in order to use its full potential. This includes the 'Europeanisation' of renewable energy policies'. Connie Hedegaard, Commissioner for Climate Action, said: 'In spite of all those arguing that nothing ambitious would come out of the Commission today, we did it. A 40% emissions reduction is the most cost-effective target for the EU and it takes account of our global responsibility. And of course Europe must continue its strong focus on renewables. That is why it matters that the Commission is proposing today a binding EU-level target. The details of the framework will now have to be agreed, but the direction for Europe has been set. If all other regions were equally ambitious about tackling climate change, the world would be in significantly better shape.'The key elements of the 2030 policy framework set out by the Commission are as follows: A binding greenhouse gas reduction target: A centre piece of the EU's energy and climate policy for 2030, the target of a 40% emissions reduction below the 1990 level would be met through domestic measures alone. The annual reduction in the 'cap' on emissions from EU ETS sectors would be increased from 1.74% now to 2.2% after 2020. Emissions from sectors outside the EU ETS would need to be cut by 30% below the 2005 level, and this effort would be shared equitably between the Member States. The Commission invites the Council and the European Parliament to agree by the end of 2014 that the EU should pledge the 40% reduction in early 2015 as part of the international negotiations on a new global climate agreement due to be concluded in Paris at the end of 2015. An EU-wide binding renewable energy target: Renewable energy will play a key role in the transition towards a competitive, secure and sustainable energy system. Driven by a more market-oriented approach with enabling conditions for emerging technologies, an EU-wide binding target for renewable energy of at least 27% in 2030 comes with significant benefits in terms of energy trade balances, reliance on indigenous energy sources, jobs and growth. An EU-level target for renewable energy is necessary to drive continued investment in the sector. However, it would not be translated into national targets through EU legislation, thus leaving flexibility for Member States to transform the energy system in a way that is adapted to national preferences and circumstances. Attainment of the EU renewables target would be ensured by the new governance system based on national energy plans (see below). Energy efficiency: Improved energy efficiency will contribute to all objectives of EU energy policy and no transition towards a competitive, secure and sustainable energy system is possible without it. The role of energy efficiency in the 2030 framework will be further considered in a review of the Energy Efficiency Directive due to be concluded later this year. The Commission will consider the potential need for amendments to the directive once the review has been completed. Member States' national energy plans will also have to cover energy efficiency. Reform of EU ETS: The Commission proposes to establish a market stability reserve at the beginning of the next ETS trading period in 2021. The reserve would both address the surplus of emission allowances that has built up in recent years and improve the system's resilience to major shocks by automatically adjusting the supply of allowances to be auctioned. The creation of such a reserve - in addition to the recently agreed delay in the auctioning of 900 million allowances until 2019-2020 ('back-loading') - is supported by a broad spectrum of stakeholders. Under the legislation, proposed today, the reserve would operate entirely according to pre-defined rules which would leave no discretion to the Commission or Member States in its implementation. Competitive, affordable and secure energy: The Commission proposes a set of key indicators to assess progress over time and to provide a factual base for potential policy response. These indicators relate to, for example, energy price differentials with major trading partners, supply diversification and reliance on indigenous energy sources, as well as the interconnection capacity between Member States. Through these indicators, policies will ensure a competitive and secure energy system in a 2030 perspective that will continue to build on market integration, supply diversification, enhanced competition, development of indigenous energy sources, as well as support to research, development and innovation. New governance system: The 2030 framework proposes a new governance framework based on national plans for competitive, secure and sustainable energy. Based on upcoming guidance by the Commission, these plans will be prepared by the Member States under a common approach, which will ensure stronger investor certainty and greater transparency, and will enhance coherence, EU coordination and surveillance. An iterative process between the Commission and Member States will ensure the plans are sufficiently ambitious, as well as their consistency and compliance over time. The Communication setting out the 2030 framework is accompanied by a Report on energy prices and costs, which assesses the key drivers and compares EU prices with those of its main trading partners. Energy prices have risen in nearly every Member State since 2008 – mainly because of taxes and levies, but also due to higher network costs. The comparison with international partners highlights rising price differentials, notably with US gas prices – which could undermine Europe's competitiveness, particularly for energy intensive industries. Nevertheless, rising energy prices can be partly offset by cost effective energy and climate policies, competitive energy markets and improved energy efficiency measures, such as using more energy-efficient products. European industry's energy efficiency efforts may need to go even further, bearing in mind physical limits, as competitors do the same and European industry decides to invest abroad to be closer to expanding markets. These findings inform the 2030 framework. Next steps are that the European Council is expected to consider the framework at its spring meeting on 20-21 March. Background: The framework builds on the existing 'climate and energy package' of targets for 2020 as well as the Commission's 2050 roadmaps for energy and for a competitive low-carbon economy. The Communication on the 2030 policy framework follows the Commission's March 2013 Green Paper, which launched a broad public consultation on the most appropriate range and structure of climate and energy targets for 2030. These documents reflect the EU's goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80-95% below 1990 levels by 2050 as part of the effort needed from developed countries.",547,Long,3911,"[{'version':

Under a new law agreed between member states and the EU Parliament, the bloc will cut carbon emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. The EU Parliament had pushed for a higher target of a 60% reduction. EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said, ""Our political commitment to becoming the first climate neutral continent by 2050 is now also a legal one."" The deal comes ahead of a virtual summit of world leaders later this week, where the US is expected to announce its own climate targets for 2030. US President Joe Biden, who will lead the meeting, rejoined the Paris climate agreement in his first day in office and has previously committed to reaching net zero emissions by 2050. The UK, meanwhile, announced radical plans to cut carbon emissions by 78% by 2035 earlier this week, although environmentalists warn that the government has consistently failed to achieve previous targets set by its independent Climate Change Committee (CCC). The EU Climate Law was agreed in the early hours of Wednesday after months of talks. It sets a limit on the levels of CO2 removal that can count towards the 2030 target, to ensure that states actively lower emissions rather than removing them from the atmosphere through forests, for example. A 15-member independent council will also be established to advise the EU on climate measures and targets. The EU Commission will announce a package of climate laws in June to support the plans. The target to reduce emissions by 55% by 2030 was initially announced by EU leaders in December but there had been pressure from the EU Parliament and environmental groups for the law to go even further. Previous EU targets had called for a 40% cut. However, environmental groups were quick to criticize the deal. Wendel Trio, the director of Climate Action Network (CAN) Europe, an alliance of environmental NGOs, said, ""The 'at least 55% emission reduction target for 2030' is not in line with the Paris agreement's ambition to limit temperature rise to 1.5C by the end of the century."" The agreement fails to tie up all member states to zero emissions by 2050 as a consequence of Poland opting out of a provisional leaders' agreement on the target last December. Poland relies on coal for 80% of the country's electricity. MEPs, who had sought a 60% cut by 2030, also failed to significantly raise the ambitions of the EU's capitals despite the claims on Wednesday that the bloc was showing global leadership on the climate emergency. ","The European Union (EU) has agreed on a new law to cut carbon emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. The decision was reached after 14 hours of intensive negotiations between member states and the EU Parliament. The new target, which was initially announced by EU leaders in December, is a significant increase from the previous 40% reduction target. The development is seen as a key milestone on the road to the United Nations climate change conference (COP26) in Glasgow this November, where leaders will underscore the need to limit planetary warming to 1.5°C by the end of the century. Under the new law, the EU will invest further in 'carbon sinks' such as forests, grasslands, and wetlands. MEPs involved in the talks claimed this would in effect equate to a 57% net reduction target for member states. The annual reduction in the 'cap' on emissions from EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) sectors will be increased from 1.74% now to 2.2% after 2020. However, environmental groups have criticized the new target, describing it as a 'farce.' Wendel Trio, the director of Climate Action Network (CAN) Europe, an alliance of environmental NGOs, said the target was not in line with the Paris agreement's ambition to limit temperature rise to 1.5°C by the end of the century.

himself on football's biggest stage with two fine goals that gave France victory in a classic World Cup encounter with Argentina, and a place in the quarter-finals. Though much of the focus before the game was on Argentina superstar Lionel Messi, it was Mbappe who produced a brilliant performance that will linger long in the memory. Mbappe's second-half double turned the game decisively in France's favour, and inflicted more pain on Argentina in what may be their final chance to win the World Cup during Messi's prime. In doing so, the 19-year-old became the first teenager to score two in a World Cup match since Pele netted twice for Brazil against Sweden in the 1958 final. Antoine Griezmann had already hit the bar with a free-kick by the time he put France ahead from the penalty spot in the ninth minute, following a searing Mbappe run that was ended by a clumsy Marcos Rojo foul. Argentina looked unable to reply for much of the first half, until Angel di Maria hauled his side level with a stunning long-range curler shortly before the break. Thousands of raucous South American supporters were sent into raptures when Gabriel Mercado diverted a Messi shot past Hugo Lloris to give Jorge Sampaoli's side the lead. But Benjamin Pavard's stunning strike levelled the scores, and 11 minutes later Mbappe had scored twice - two clinical finishes that ensured the 2014 beaten finalists would be going home at the last 16. For the first he swept body and ball into space before driving past Franco Armani to score, while the second was swept in crisply at the end of a counter-attack as Argentina chased another leveller. Substitute Sergio Aguero did get a late consolation - a low header from a pin-point Messi cross in the 93rd minute. But this defeat will raise many questions, including about Messi's international future, and that of manager Sampaoli. France, meanwhile, will go on to play Uruguay, who beat Portugal 2-1 in Sochi. Les Bleus warming to Russia after sluggish start: Despite their obvious attacking talent, there were still plenty of questions around this France team after a group phase during which they never really hit their stride. Les Bleus qualified comfortably as Group C winners but laboured to a win over Australia, beat Peru unconvincingly then played out a dire draw with Denmark, the only 0-0 of the tournament so far. They must have just been waiting for the knockout stage to start, because here we finally witnessed the kind of blistering display many expected sooner, with Mbappe the embodiment. His run for the penalty was sensational, pure athleticism coupled with bravery and belief as he drove past defender after defender; all Rojo could do was haul him down. His two goals were not bad either. Responding to concerns about his team's style, manager Didier Deschamps had made the point that under his watch tournament progress is only building in momentum. In 2014 there was the World Cup quarter-final loss to winners Germany, then the Euro 2016 final defeat by Portugal in extra time. And the Portuguese could be next for a team looking very dangerous indeed. What now for Messi and Sampaoli? This is an Argentina team around which there seem to have been so many major issues, with rumours of dressing room discontent, reports Messi was calling the shots in team selection, and a sense they were simply not getting the best from the five-time Ballon d'Or winner. During the nine minutes after the Mercado goal that put them ahead early in the second half, all was forgotten in the stands packed with light-blue-and-white striped shirts. But Mbappe's brilliance - after Pavard's stunning equalising goal - brought them crashing back to reality. That reality is this could well be the end for a generation that has failed to win a major title despite promising so much. This last-16 exit follows three consecutive defeats in major finals - the World Cup in 2014, the Copa America in 2015, and the special centenary Copa America in 2016. After that third final defeat, Messi announced his retirement, before changing his mind a month later. Six days ago he turned 31. Following the final whistle here, all of the Argentina players lingered long on the pitch, only leaving after France had. Messi was first down the tunnel, with his head bowed and the captain's armband in his hands. Kylian Mbappe became the first teenager to score multiple goals in a World Cup tournament since Michael Owen for England in 1998'I won't decide my future today' - what they saidArgentina boss Jorge Sampaoli: 'This is very painful, especially because the players have made a huge effort.'It was a very difficult game but we have not achieved our goal here in Russia. I'm sad, I'm frustrated - I think that's quite normal.'I won't decide my future today.'France boss Didier Deschamps: 'Our team is much younger, but it's there. We answered the call, we have a lot of character and it was not easy as we were leading, then there was an equaliser, then we were 2-1 behind, but we kept fighting.'There is an excellent mentality in this group and we did everything to go further. Since I am responsible for everything, particularly when it doesn't go well, I'm very proud.'Man of the match Kylian Mbappe: 'It's flattering to be the second teenager to score twice in a World Cup match after Pele but let's put things in context. Pele is another category, but it's good to be among these people.'As I've already and always said, at a World Cup you have all the top-level players, so it's an opportunity to show what you can do and what your abilities are. There's no better place than a World Cup.'Messi yet to score in World Cup knockout stage. Messi has played 756 minutes of football in World Cup knockout-stage matches, but has failed to score. Messi is the only player to have delivered an assist in each of the past four World Cups. This was just the fifth time Argentina have conceded four or more goals in a World Cup match, and first since losing 4-0 to Germany in the 2010 quarter-finals. France scored with all four of their shots on target. They had scored three goals from 12 shots on target in the group stages. There were eight yellow cards, equalling the most shown in a single game so far at the 2018 World Cup (also Belgium v Panama). Seven of the eight shots on target were scored, with the exception Messi's in the 85th minute. France have never lost an international match in which Griezmann has scored. At 30.16 yards, Di Maria's equaliser for Argentina was the longest-range goal scored so far in the 2018 World Cup. Pavard's goal was his first for France, in his ninth appearance. Edinson Cavani scored two superb goals as Uruguay beat Portugal to set up a World Cup quarter-final meeting with France. Defeat for the European champions finished Cristiano Ronaldo's hopes of success in Russia just hours after Lionel Messi and Argentina were knocked out, beaten 4-3 by Les Bleus. This World Cup has not been short of stunning goals and Cavani added another to the collection when he opened the scoring early on, playing a superb one-two with Luis Suarez before thumping home a header from his strike partner's cross. Uruguay had not conceded a goal at this World Cup before Pepe rose unmarked to nod in an equaliser from close range, prompting a brief spell of dominance for Portugal. But Cavani secured Uruguay's place in the last eight - and a trip to Nizhny Novgorod to face France on Friday - when he steered a brilliant shot beyond goalkeeper Rui Patricio. The win may have come at a price, though, as Cavani limped off late on. Cavani (21) found Suarez (9) with a precise pass before bursting into the area to score the opening goalUruguay made a slow start to this World Cup by scraping past Egypt 1-0 but have got stronger with every game - and in Suarez and Cavani, they possess one of the most potent strike partnerships in Russia. Exquisite technique, timing and teamwork were all present as the two combined to score a goal inside the first 10 minutes that few sides at the tournament would have been able to prevent. Cavani - hugging the touchline on the right wing - hit a brilliant crossfield pass to Suarez wide left. The Barcelona forward held the ball for a moment as Cavani powered into the area before whipping in a cross for his strike partner to head home. Of Cavani's 45 international goals, Suarez has now assisted 12 of them. It is, however, a partnership that could be disrupted. After scoring his side's second with a clinical finish on the counter, the Paris St-Germain striker left the field, appearing to clutch his hamstring. A serious injury for Cavani would undoubtedly be a blow but this Uruguay team is arguably greater than the sum of its parts. Against Portugal, they looked well balanced and while they did concede, it was the first goal against them in 597 minutes of football, a run stretching back to August last year. Knockouts no-show for Ronaldo once againRonaldo scored four goals to take Portugal through to the last 16 almost on his own, but once again was unable to continue that form beyond the group stages. The Real Madrid forward had failed to find the net in his four previous knockout games and never really troubled Fernando Muslera in the Uruguay goal on Saturday evening. He did not have a single touch of the ball inside the area in the first half while his only shot on target in the entire game came in the second minute, when his low effort from distance was straight at Muslera. Ronaldo will be 37 by the time of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, meaning this could have been his last appearance on the biggest international stage. But although time may not be on his side, his form is, this game apart. He scored 52 goals in 118 games for Portugal before turning 30 - but since then has hit 32 in 34.'Cristiano still has a lot to give to football and I hope he will stay to help the young players grow and develop,' Portugal coach Fernando Santos said. We have a team with many young players and of course we all want him there with us.'Cavani injury unclear - what they saidUruguay coach Oscar Tabarez: 'Cavani sustained an injury tonight and we will have to see how that evolves as it's not clear at this stage how serious it is. But as always we will bank on the strength of our team as a collective.'The distinctive feature of the game was the dedication the players showed on the pitch, and that is the way that we see football.'It was difficult. Portugal had more possession and were often in our half of the pitch, and it would have been better for us to have more of the ball and play the game closer to their goal. But we have a very strong team in terms of our mindset and I am very happy.'Portugal boss Fernando Santos: 'First of all, congratulations to Uruguay. It's very sad for Portugal though. We know that the squares have been full back home and that the people there were really rooting for us.'We could feel their presence with us and there's a real sadness in the dressing room that we weren't able to make it through for them.'In football, there are no moral victories and I would have preferred to play worse and win the match. But I do feel that the second half was very good from us in terms of desire and our determination to score.'We tried our best and we played a good game, I think. But you always want to win, and we lost, so well done to Uruguay for making it through.'A 1930 repeat for Uruguay? This is the first time Uruguay have won their opening four games at a World Cup tournament since 1930, with the fourth game in that run being their 4-2 victory over Argentina in the final. Portugal have lost their past four World Cup knockout matches, since a goalless draw with England (and a penalty shootout win) in the 2006 quarter-final. Uruguay's winning goal came from their only shot of any kind in the second half. They had just 30% possession after half-time. Edinson Cavani scored his 44th and 45th goals for Uruguay. Uruguay striker Edinson Cavani scored with both of his shots on target. Since 1966, only Grzegorz Lato and Andrzej Szarmach (five for Poland) and Michael Ballack and Miroslav Klose (five for Germany) have combined for more World Cup goals than Uruguay's Edinson Cavani and Luis Suarez (four). This was Portuguese star Cristiano Ronaldo's 38th game in World Cups/European Championships - no player has played in more across the two competitions (he is level with Bastian Schweinsteiger). Ronaldo has played 514 minutes of football in the knockout stages of the World Cup, but has failed to score or provide an assist. He attempted six shots for Portugal in this match (one on target) - one more than the entire Uruguay team managed over the 90 minutes. At 35 years and 124 days, Pepe became Portugal's oldest goalscorer in a major tournament match (World Cup and European Championships).",554,Long,2332,"[{'version': 'Human', 'Compression Ratio': 0.23138297870000002}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Compression Ratio': 0.2380319149}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Compression Ratio': 0.2282801418}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Novel N-gram %': 47.3214285714}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Novel N-gram %': 14.2857142857}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Novel N-gram %': 7.1111111111}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Flesch Reading Ease': 56.1002351097, 'Flesch-Kincaid Grade': 9.3641483804, 'Gunning Fog': 12.687425984, 'SMOG Index': 12.4048191831}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Flesch Reading Ease': 51.2098643347, 'Flesch-Kincaid Grade': 11.8628244524, 'Gunning Fog': 13.9890160183, 'SMOG Index': 13.095310086}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Flesch Reading Ease': 49.765356909, 'Flesch-Kincaid Grade': 12.339477968, 'Gunning Fog': 14.9604640284, 'SMOG Index': 13.7802553364}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Distinct-1': 0.6808510638, 'Distinct-2': 0.9420731707000001}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Distinct-1': 0.7872340426000001, 'Distinct-2': 0.9786585366}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Distinct-1': 0.7009345794, 'Distinct-2': 0.9187500000000001}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'TP': 43, 'FP': 178, 'FN': 26, 'Keyword Precision': 0.1945701357, 'Keyword Recall': 0.6231884058, 'Keyword F1': 0.2965517241, 'Keywords Found': 'argentina, ball, cavani, cristiano, cup, did, edinson, fernando, final, football, france, games, goal, goals, group, half, injury, international, just, knockout, kylian, match, mbappe, messi, minute, minutes, pavard, pele, penalty, play, played, portugal, quarter, ronaldo, score, scored, second, suarez, time, tournament, uruguay, win, world', 'Keywords Missing': 'cross, defeat, failed, game, hit, home, long, lost, major, past, pitch, place, players, range, really, run, russia, sampaoli, shot, shots, stage, start, strike, stunning, target, team'}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'TP': 45, 'FP': 222, 'FN': 24, 'Keyword Precision': 0.1685393258, 'Keyword Recall': 0.652173913, 'Keyword F1': 0.2678571429, 'Keywords Found': 'argentina, cavani, cup, defeat, edinson, failed, final, france, goal, goals, half, home, international, kylian, long, major, match, mbappe, messi, minute, minutes, pavard, penalty, pitch, place, played, players, portugal, quarter, range, run, sampaoli, score, scored, second, shot, shots, strike, stunning, suarez, team, time, uruguay, win, world', 'Keywords Missing': 'ball, cristiano, cross, did, fernando, football, game, games, group, hit, injury, just, knockout, lost, past, pele, play, really, ronaldo, russia, stage, start, target, tournament'}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'TP': 47, 'FP': 188, 'FN': 22, 'Keyword Precision': 0.2, 'Keyword Recall': 0.6811594203, 'Keyword F1': 0.3092105263, 'Keywords Found': 'argentina, cavani, cristiano, cup, defeat, edinson, final, football, france, game, games, goal, goals, group, half, international, just, knockout, kylian, long, major, match, mbappe, messi, pele, place, play, played, portugal, quarter, range, ronaldo, run, russia, sampaoli, score, scored, second, shot, stage, start, stunning, time, tournament, uruguay, win, world', 'Keywords Missing': 'ball, cross, did, failed, fernando, hit, home, injury, lost, minute, minutes, past, pavard, penalty, pitch, players, really, shots, strike, suarez, target, team'}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Jaccard Similarity (vs Human)': 1.0}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Jaccard Similarity (vs Human)': 0.1338028169}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Jaccard Similarity (vs Human)': 0.1367088608}]","[{'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'ROUGE-1 F1 (vs Human)': 0.5058087578, 'ROUGE-2 F1 (vs Human)': 0.127126231, 'ROUGE-L F1 (vs Human)': 0.1912421805}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'ROUGE-1 F1 (vs Human)': 0.4666056725, 'ROUGE-2 F1 (vs Human)': 0.1356553621, 'ROUGE-L F1 (vs Human)': 0.1665141812}]","[{'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'BERTScore P (vs Human)': 0.9558963776, 'BERTScore R (vs Human)': 0.9593147635, 'BERTScore F1 (vs Human)': 0.9576024413}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'BERTScore P (vs Human)': 0.9460567236, 'BERTScore R (vs Human)': 0.9526320696, 'BERTScore F1 (vs Human)': 0.9493330121}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Q2 Model Output': '1', 'Q2_score': 1}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Q2 Model Output': '1', 'Q2_score': 1}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Q2 Model Output': '1', 'Q2_score': 1}]","[{'Human_vs_Plain_winner': 'Human', 'Plain_vs_Human_winner': 'Plain LLM', 'Human_vs_RAG_winner': 'Human', 'RAG_vs_Human_winner': 'RAG LLM', 'RAG_vs_Plain_winner': 'RAG LLM', 'Plain_vs_RAG_winner': 'Plain LLM'}, {'Human_vs_Plain_confidence_score': 4, 'Plain_vs_Human_confidence_score': 4, 'Human_vs_RAG_confidence_score': 4, 'RAG_vs_Human_confidence_score': 4, 'RAG_vs_Plain_confidence_score': 4, 'Plain_vs_RAG_confidence_score': 4}, {'Human_vs_Plain_reasoning_text': 'Article 1 provides more detailed information about the match, including the exact score, player names, and specific events.

Kylian Mbappe, the 19-year-old French forward, scored a brace in France's 4-3 victory over Argentina, while Edinson Cavani netted a pair of goals for Uruguay in their 2-1 win over Portugal. The match between France and Argentina was a classic encounter, with Mbappe stealing the show. The Paris Saint-Germain star's two goals in the second half turned the tide in France's favor, inflicting more pain on Argentina in what may be their final chance to win the World Cup during Lionel Messi's prime. Antoine Griezmann opened the scoring for France from the penalty spot in the ninth minute, following a searing Mbappe run that was ended by a clumsy Marcos Rojo foul. Argentina looked unable to reply for much of the first half, until Angel di Maria leveled the score with a stunning long-range curler shortly before the break. Gabriel Mercado gave Argentina the lead early in the second half, but Benjamin Pavard's stunning strike levelled the scores, and 11 minutes later Mbappe had scored twice - two clinical finishes that ensured the 2014 beaten finalists would be going home at the last 16. Substitute Sergio Aguero got a late consolation for Argentina, but this defeat will raise many questions, including about Messi's international future, and that of manager Jorge Sampaoli. Meanwhile, Uruguay and Portugal played out a more defensive affair, with Cavani's two superb goals securing Uruguay's place in the quarter-finals. Pepe equalized for Portugal with a header from close range, but Cavani's clinical finishes ensured Uruguay's progression. Cavani's first goal came after a precise pass from Suarez, while his second was a brilliant shot from the edge of the area. The win may have come at a price, though, as Cavani limped off late on. France will now face Uruguay in the quarter-finals, with the winner advancing to the semi-finals. ## What now for Messi and Sampaoli? This is an Argentina team around which there seem to have been so many major issues, with rumors of dressing room discontent, reports Messi was calling the shots in team selection, and a sense they were simply not getting the best from the five-time Ballon d'Or winner. During the nine minutes after the Mercado goal that put them ahead early in the second half, all was forgotten in the stands packed with light-blue-and-white striped shirts. But Mbappe's brilliance - after Pavard's stunning equalising goal - brought them crashing back to reality. That reality is this could well be the end for a generation that has failed to win a major title despite promising so much. This last-16 exit follows three consecutive defeats in major finals - the World Cup in 2014, the Copa America in 2015, and the special centenary Copa America in 2016. After that third final defeat, Messi announced his retirement, before changing his mind a month later. Six days ago he turned 31. Following the final whistle here, all of the Argentina players lingered long on the pitch, only leaving after France had. Messi was first down the tunnel, with his head bowed and the captain's armband in his hands.","France and Uruguay advanced to the quarter-finals of the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia, eliminating European champions Portugal and four-time champions Argentina, respectively. In the first match, Kylian Mbappe announced himself on football's biggest stage with two fine goals that gave France a 2-1 victory over Argentina in a classic World Cup encounter. Argentina's Lionel Messi, who had scored four goals to take his side through to the last 16 almost single-handedly, was unable to continue his form beyond the group stages. In the second match, Edinson Cavani scored two superb goals as Uruguay beat Portugal 2-1 in Sochi. Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo, who had scored four goals to take his side through to the last 16 almost single-handedly, was also unable to continue his form beyond the group stages. France will play Uruguay in the quarter-finals on Friday in Nizhny Novgorod. ## Uruguay's perfect start Uruguay had not conceded a goal at this World Cup before Pepe rose unmarked to nod in an equaliser from close range, prompting a brief spell of dominance for Portugal. But Cavani secured Uruguay's place in the last eight - and a trip to Nizhny Novgorod to face France on Friday - when he steered a brilliant shot beyond goalkeeper Rui Patricio. The win may have come at a price, though, as Cavani limped off late on. Uruguay's winning goal came from their only shot of any kind in the second half. They had just 30% possession after half-time. This is the first time Uruguay have won their opening four games at a World Cup tournament since 1930, with the fourth game in that run being their 4-2 victory over Argentina in the final. ## France's blistering display France, meanwhile, will go on to play Uruguay, who beat Portugal 2-1 in Sochi. Les Bleus qualified comfortably as Group C winners but laboured to a win over Australia, beat Peru unconvincingly then played out a dire draw with Denmark, the only 0-0 of the tournament so far. They must have just been waiting for the knockout stage to start, because here we finally witnessed the kind of blistering display many expected sooner, with Mbappe the embodiment. Mbappe's second-half double turned the game decisively in France's favour, and inflicted more pain on Argentina in what may be their final chance to win the World Cup during Messi's prime. In doing so, the 19-year-old became the first teenager to score two in a World Cup match since Pele netted twice for Brazil against Sweden in the 1958 final. ## Argentina's struggles This last-16 exit follows three consecutive defeats in major finals - the World Cup in 2014, the Copa America in 2015, and the special centenary Copa America in 2016. After that third final defeat, Messi announced his retirement, before changing his mind a month later. Argentina looked unable to reply for much of the first half, until Angel di Maria hauled his side level with a stunning long-range curler shortly before the break. But this defeat will raise many questions, including about Messi's international future, and that of manager Jorge Sampaoli. "
2025-02-10,UK heavy metal band Black Sabbath announces final performance with original lineup,https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/UK_heavy_metal_band_Black_Sabbath_announces_final_performance_with_original_lineup,Entertainment,"On Wednesday, it was announced that the UK heavy metal music act Black Sabbath was scheduled to play a final show with the band's original lineup, which consisted of lead vocalist Ozzy Osbourne, guitarist Tony Iommi, bassist Geezer Butler,and drummer Bill Ward. The performance, dubbed 'The Back to the Beginning' show, was slated for July 5, 2025 at Villa Park in the band's hometown of Birmingham, England. Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello was slated to serve as the event's musical director.It will be the band's first performance with the original lineup in 20 years. Original drummer Bill Ward departed the group in 2012 due to disputes regarding contracts. The band's final studio album13was recorded without him, and he was absent from the band's 81-date farewell tour in 2017 as well. Rage Against the Machine drummer Brad Wilkand Osbourne's backing band drummer Tommy Clufetos substituted Ward's percussion duties on the album and on the tour, respectively. Although the band's final show in 2017 was played to a sold-out crowd, the band had expressed their desire to do a 'proper' farewell show that would include Ward.The event's full lineup includes heavy metal acts such asMetallica,Slayer,Panteraand others. According to BBC News Online, the performance was also said to feature a 'supergroup' comprised of Morello, Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan, Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash, Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst,and Wolfgang Van Halen. Sharon Osbourne said they would be performing covers of songs from Black Sabbath and Osbourne's back catalogue. Tom Morello, the event's musical director, called it the 'greatest heavy metal show ever.'Tony Iommi said, 'It's been an incredible journey, but it's only fitting that it ends here, where it all began in Aston. None of this would've been possible without Ozzy, Geezer,and Bill. What we created together was bigger than any one of us, and I'll always be grateful for that.' According to Geezer Butler, 'It'll be the first time the Black Sabbath played has played in Aston since we used to live there. And where we wrote most of our first album — places like Aston Community Center and Burlington Hall down High Street. So it's a return home for us when it all started and it will be a very special occasion for us all.'76-year-old Osbourne was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2020 and stopped touring in 2023. Osborne said he planned to open with a solo set 'before joining with Black Sabbath for his final bow.' He said, 'Time for me to give back to the place where I was born. How blessed am I to do it with the help of people whom I love. Birmingham is the true home of metal. Birmingham Forever.'All proceeds from the show were said to be donated to the charities Cure Parkinson's,Birmingham Children's Hospital, and Acorns Children's Hospice.According to his wife, Sharon Osbourne, '[Ozzy's] doing really great. He's so excited about this, about being with the guys again and all his friends. It's exciting for everyone. Ozzy didn't have a chance to say goodbye to his friends, to his fans.' She indicated that Osbourne felt there hadn't been proper closure. 'This is his full stop.' Osbourne himself said, 'I'm not going to get up there and do a half-hearted Ozzy looking for sympathy. What's the [expletive] point in that? I'm not going up there in a [expletive] wheelchair.'Black Sabbath formed in 1968 in Birmingham, and released theirself-titled debut album in 1970. Their worldwide album sales exceeded 75 million

Black Sabbath's original lineup of Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward will play one final farewell show this July 5 at Villa Park in Birmingham, England. Black Sabbath has been pretty vocal about wanting to do a proper farewell show with Ward behind the kit, and now it's finally happening. For those unaware, Black Sabbath sadly ended in 2017 with only three-fourths of its classic lineup in tact. Osbourne, Iommi, and Butler released their final album as Black Sabbath named 13 in 2013 and embarked on a farewell tour without Ward, who quit the band (or was fired depending on who you ask) in 2012 due to contract disputes. 13 featured Rage Against The Machine drummer Brad Wilk, while the final shows featured Osbourne's solo band drummer Tommy Clufetos.'It's my time to go Back to the Beginning… time for me to give back to the place where I was born,' said Osbourne. 'How blessed am I to do it with the help of people whom I love. Birmingham is the true home of metal. Birmingham Forever.'The show also appears to be Osbourne's farewell show, who notes he'll 'play his own short set before joining with Black Sabbath for his final bow.' The full lineup for Back To The Beginning is: Black Sabbath, Ozzy Osbourne, Metallica, Slayer, Pantera, Gojira, Halestorm, Alice In Chains, Lamb of God, Anthrax, Mastodon, Billy Corgan (The Smashing Pumpkins), David Draiman (Disturbed), Duff McKagan (Guns N' Roses), Fred Durst (Limp Bizkit), Lzzy Hale (Halestorm), Jake E Lee (ex- Ozzy Osbourne), (ex-) Jonathan Davis (Korn), KK Downing (ex- Judas Priest), (ex-) Mike Bordin (Faith No More), Papa V Perpetua (Ghost), Rudy Sarzo, Sammy Hagar, Slash (Guns N' Roses), Sleep Token's II (Sleep Token), Tom Morello and Wolfgang Van Halen. Tickets for the show go on sale February 14 at 10am GMT here. All profits will go to Cure Parkinson's, Birmingham Children's Hospital and Acorn Children's Hospice, a Children's Hospice supported by Aston Villa. Black Sabbath's Geezer Butler has now offered his first statement since the band announced their one-off all-day Back to the Beginning concert taking place in Aston Villa on July 5. The all-star concert will feature the reunion of all four original Black Sabbath members, as well as an Ozzy Osbourne solo performance and supporting sets from Metallica, Slayer, Pantera, Gojira, Halestorm, Alice in Chains, Lamb of God, Anthrax and Mastodon. What Geezer Butler Said About Black Sabbath's Reunion Show? Posting to his Instagram account, Butler offered, 'Looking forward to seeing you all on July the 5th at Villa Park. It'll be the first time the Black Sabbath played has played in Aston since we used to live there. And where we wrote most of our first album — places like Aston Community Center and Burlington Hall down High Street.' 'So it's a return home for us when it all started and it will be a very special occasion for us all. See you there,' remarked Butler What Tony Iommi Had to Say? Butler's statement follows one issued by guitarist Tony Iommi earlier today.'It's been an incredible journey, but it's only fitting that it ends here, where it all began in Aston,' stated Iommi through his X social media account. 'It's great to be honoured by your fellow musicians and at the same time support good causes. None of this would've been possible without Ozzy, Geezer, and Bill. What we created together was bigger than any one of us, and I'll always be grateful for that,' he concluded. Ozzy Osbourne will reunite with all the original members of Black Sabbath for the first time in 20 years, in a gig that will be his last and that's being billed as the 'greatest' heavy metal show ever, promoters said Wednesday. The band, one of the most influential of all heavy metal bands, will headline 'The Back to the Beginning' show on July 5 at Villa Park, home of the Aston Villa Football Club in Birmingham, England.'It's my time to go back to the beginning … time for me to give back to the place where I was born,' Osbourne said in a statement. 'How blessed am I to do it with the help of people whom I love. Birmingham is the true home of metal. Birmingham forever.' Osbourne, who was the band's front man during its peak period in the 1970s and who was widely known as the 'Prince of Darkness,' will deliver his own short set before Sabbath bandmates, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward, join him for the first time in two decades. The all-day event will also feature a host of major metal bands including Metallica, Slayer and Alice In Chains, with more names to be announced shortly. 'This will be the greatest heavy metal show ever,' music director Tom Morello said. In 2020, Osbourne revealed he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and he paused touring in 2023 after extensive spinal surgery. He has struggled with health issues since 2003 following a near-fatal quad bike crash, injuries that were aggravated in 2019 when he fell at home. Sabbath's story began in Birmingham in 1968 when the four original members were looking to escape a life of factory work. Their eponymous debut album in 1970 made the U. K. top 10 and paved the way for a string of hit albums, including 1971's 'Master of Reality' and 'Vol.4' a year later. They went on to become one of the most influential and successful metal bands of all time, selling more than 75 million albums worldwide. Osbourne's fame expanded into the mainstream in the early 2000s, when he joined his wife Sharon Osbourne, and two of their children in the hugely successful MTV reality TV show 'The Osbournes.' All profits from the July 5 show will go to charities including Cure Parkinson's, Birmingham Children's Hospital and Acorn Children's Hospice, which is supported by Aston Villa. Tickets go on sale Friday, Feb. 14. Black Sabbath's original lineup will reunite for the first time in 20 years for a concert billed as Ozzy Osbourne's last-ever show. The Back to the Beginning charity concert, taking place on Saturday, July 5, at Villa Park, in the band's Birmingham hometown, will feature a gargantuan rock lineup including Metallica, Pantera, Slayer, and a supergroup of Billy Corgan, Slash, Fred Durst, Wolfgang Van Halen, and Tom Morello, who serves as the event's musical director. Filling out the main bill are: Gojira, Anthrax, Alice in Chains, Mastodon, Lamb of God, and Halestorm. Guns N' Roses' Duff McKagan and Slash are also on the lineup. Osbourne will play a brief solo set before being joined by the band, and some of the supporting artists will play Sabbath and Ozzy solo songs, according to Sharon Osbourne. More artists are still to be announced. Ozzy Osbourne said, 'It's my time to go Back to the Beginning….time for me to give back to the place where I was born. How blessed am I to do it with the help of people whom I love. Birmingham is the true home of metal. Birmingham Forever.' Morello added, 'This will be the greatest heavy metal show ever.' Speaking with BBC News, Sharon Osbourne said her husband is 'doing really great. He's so excited about this, about being with the guys again and all his friends.' She continued, 'Ozzy didn't have a chance to say goodbye to his friends, to his fans, and he feels there's no been no full stop. This is his full stop.' All profits will go to Cure Parkinson's, Birmingham Children's Hospital, and Acorn Children's Hospice, according to a press release. Ozzy Osbourne and Black Sabbath announce final show. Ozzy Osbourne and Black Sabbath are reuniting for one last time, to play a fund-raising concert in Birmingham on 5 July. The heavy metal pioneers will headline a spectacular one-day festival at Villa Park, featuring dozens of bands they inspired, including Metallica, Pantera, Slayer, Gojira and Anthrax. The concert will mark the first time that Black Sabbath's original line-up - Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward - have played together in 20 years. Osbourne, who has largely been forced to stop touring due to a combination of Parkinson's and spinal injuries, will play a short solo set before joining his bandmates. His wife, Sharon, told BBC News he was determined to put on one final show.'He's doing great. He's doing really great,' she said.'He's so excited about this, about being with the guys again and all his friends. It's exciting for everyone.'However, she said the concert would definitively be the 76-year-old's final show. 'Ozzy didn't have a chance to say goodbye to his friends, to his fans, and he feels there's no been no full stop. This is his full stop.' The concert, dubbed Back To The Beginning, was announced at Villa Park on Wednesday by Sharon, and Black Sabbath's Tony Iommi. Rage Against The Machine guitarist Tom Morello, who is serving as the event's musical director, said it would be 'the greatest heavy metal show ever'. Proceeds from the show will support Cure Parkinson's, the Birmingham Children's Hospital and Acorn Children's Hospice, a Children's Hospice supported by Aston Villa. Other acts on the line-up include Alice In Chains, Halestorm, Lamb Of God and Mastodon. In addition, the concert will feature a 'supergroup', with stars like Billy Corgan, Slash, Fred Durst, Wolfgang Van Halen and Tom Morello.'It's an endless amount of people,' said Sharon Osbourne. 'They're going to be doing some Sabbath songs, some Ozzy songs, and they'll all mix together. 'Different little groups will be coming on, but they're all icons.'",627,Long,1683,"[{'version': 'Human', 'Compression Ratio': 0.3611977542}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Compression Ratio': 0.25015595760000003}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Compression Ratio': 0.1503431067}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Novel N-gram %': 38.7453874539}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Novel N-gram %': 14.2076502732}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Novel N-gram %': 5.3846153846}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Flesch Reading Ease': 61.5629653979, 'Flesch-Kincaid Grade': 8.7751389026, 'Gunning Fog': 10.3427385072, 'SMOG Index': 10.73248109}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Flesch Reading Ease': 64.4885789474, 'Flesch-Kincaid Grade': 9.4945263158, 'Gunning Fog': 10.4210526316, 'SMOG Index': 9.8118437636}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Flesch Reading Ease': 53.3756631799, 'Flesch-Kincaid Grade': 11.7519205021, 'Gunning Fog': 13.0746443515, 'SMOG Index': 11.9792484733}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Distinct-1': 0.7720797721, 'Distinct-2': 0.9714285714}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Distinct-1': 0.7754237288, 'Distinct-2': 0.9787234043}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Distinct-1': 0.8227848101, 'Distinct-2': 0.9681528662000001}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'TP': 38, 'FP': 238, 'FN': 8, 'Keyword Precision': 0.1376811594, 'Keyword Recall': 0.8260869565000001, 'Keyword F1': 0.2360248447, 'Keywords Found': 'announced, aston, band, beginning, birmingham, black, butler, children, farewell, final, friends, geezer, heavy, home, hospice, iommi, july, lineup, metal, morello, original, osbourne, ozzy, park, parkinson, place, play, sabbath, said, sharon, slayer, solo, stop, time, tom, tony, villa, ward', 'Keywords Missing': 'alice, anthrax, bands, chains, concert, halestorm, including, metallica'}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'TP': 38, 'FP': 145, 'FN': 8, 'Keyword Precision': 0.2076502732, 'Keyword Recall': 0.8260869565000001, 'Keyword F1': 0.33187772930000004, 'Keywords Found': 'alice, announced, anthrax, aston, band, bands, beginning, birmingham, black, butler, chains, children, concert, farewell, final, geezer, halestorm, heavy, hospice, iommi, july, lineup, metal, metallica, original, osbourne, ozzy, park, parkinson, place, sabbath, said, slayer, solo, time, tony, villa, ward', 'Keywords Missing': 'friends, home, including, morello, play, sharon, stop, tom'}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'TP': 37, 'FP': 100, 'FN': 9, 'Keyword Precision': 0.2700729927, 'Keyword Recall': 0.8043478261, 'Keyword F1': 0.4043715847, 'Keywords Found': 'alice, announced, anthrax, band, birmingham, black, butler, chains, children, concert, farewell, final, geezer, halestorm, heavy, hospice, including, iommi, july, lineup, metal, metallica, original, osbourne, ozzy, park, parkinson, play, sabbath, sharon, slayer, solo, stop, time, tony, villa, ward', 'Keywords Missing': 'aston, bands, beginning, friends, home, morello, place, said, tom'}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Jaccard Similarity (vs Human)': 1.0}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Jaccard Similarity (vs Human)': 0.25761772850000003}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Jaccard Similarity (vs Human)': 0.16909620990000002}]","[{'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'ROUGE-1 F1 (vs Human)': 0.5867689358, 'ROUGE-2 F1 (vs Human)': 0.3439000961, 'ROUGE-L F1 (vs Human)': 0.2703739214}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'ROUGE-1 F1 (vs Human)': 0.4077892325, 'ROUGE-2 F1 (vs Human)': 0.1607347876, 'ROUGE-L F1 (vs Human)': 0.1924398625}]","[{'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'BERTScore P (vs Human)': 0.968960762, 'BERTScore R (vs Human)': 0.9682461023000001, 'BERTScore F1 (vs Human)': 0.968603313}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'BERTScore P (vs Human)': 0.9643259048, 'BERTScore R (vs Human)': 0.9551332593, 'BERTScore F1 (vs Human)': 0.9597075582000001}]","[{'version': 'Human', 'Q2 Model Output': '1', 'Q2_score': 1}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Q2 Model Output': '1', 'Q2_score': 1}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Q2 Model Output': '1', 'Q2_score': 1}]","[{'Human_vs_Plain_winner': 'Human', 'Plain_vs_Human_winner': 'Plain LLM', 'Human_vs_RAG_winner': 'Human', 'RAG_vs_Human_winner': 'RAG LLM', 'RAG_vs_Plain_winner': 'RAG LLM', 'Plain_vs_RAG_winner': 'Plain LLM'}, {'Human_vs_Plain_confidence_score': 5, 'Plain_vs_Human_confidence_score': 5, 'Human_vs_RAG_confidence_score': 4, 'RAG_vs_Human_confidence_score': 4, 'RAG_vs_Plain_confidence_score': 5, 'Plain_vs_RAG_confidence_score': 5}, {'Human_vs_Plain_reasoning_text': 'Article 1 is the better article overall due to its more detailed and accurate information about the concert, including the lineup and the charities involved.

2022-09-26,United Kingdom buries Queen Elizabeth II after state funeral,https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_buries_Queen_Elizabeth_II_after_state_funeral,Politics & Policy,"On Monday, September 19, Elizabeth II, the late Queen of the United Kingdom and the fourteen Commonwealth realms received a state funeral at Westminster Abbey,London, England before she was buried at Windsor Castle in Berkshire.The royal state funeral at Westminster Abbey was attended by some two thousand people including hundreds of national leaders, heads of state and foreign royalty. 'Few leaders receive the outpouring of love that we have seen,' said Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby. Outside hundreds of thousands of people had gathered in the streets of London to pay their respects to Elizabeth and witness the procession. After the funeral service, Elizabeth was transported to St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle where she was lowered into the Royal Vault, the final resting place of many former British monarchs. Here, the Royal Regalia was removed from the coffin.In the evening, Elizabeth was moved to King George VI Memorial Chapel which is a separate part of St George's. A private family service was held and she was buried next to her husband, father, mother and sister. Elizabeth died Thursday, September 8 at the age of 96 at Balmoral Castle, Scotland after a reign of 70 years. The news was announced at 18:30BST(UTC+1) by a formal notice outside Buckingham Palace. Earlier that day various members of the British royal family had traveled to Balmoral to be by the side of the Queen as doctors said they became concerned for the 96-year-old monarch's health. Elizabeth's husband and Prince Consort, Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, died in 2021 at the age of 99.Elizabeth's eldest son, Charles the former Prince of Wales, automatically became King on her death and will be known as King Charles III. His eldest son, William, inherited the Duchy of Cornwall from his father, whilst retaining his title of Duke of Cambridge. Charles was officially proclaimed as King last Saturday by the Accession Councilin a televised ceremony at St James's Palace in London. All living former prime ministers were in attendance.'We mourn profoundly the passing of a cherished sovereign and a much-loved mother,' said Charles in a statement. 'I know her loss will be deeply felt throughout the country, the Realms and the Commonwealth, and by countless people around the world.'Just two days prior, Elizabeth II was still performing her duties as head-of-state as she approved Liz Truss as the new prime minister, succeeding Boris Johnson who tendered his resignation in person to the Queen on the same day.Truss called Elizabeth 'the rock on which modern Britain was built' and 'provided us with the stability and strength that we needed'. She declared Britain to be 'devastated' by her death. About the new monarch, Charles, Truss said, 'We offer him our loyalty and devotion, just as his mother devoted so much, to so many, for so long. And with the passing of the second Elizabethan age, we usher in a new era in the magnificent history of our great country, exactly as Her Majesty would have wished, by saying the words 'God save the King'.'Born in London on April 21, 1926 as Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor, she was not in the immediate line of succession to the throne. King Edward VIII, however, abdicated in 1936 to Elizabeth's father, King George VI and Elizabeth became heir apparent. During World War II, Elizabeth began making public statements at the age of 14 with the first being a message to children who had been evacuated. After reaching the age of 18, she served with the Auxiliary Territorial Service as a truck driver.In 1947, she married Philip with whom she had four children: Charles(1948), Anne(1950), Andrew(1960) and Edward(1964).Elizabeth's reign was the longest in the history of Britain and the second-longest sovereign monarch of all recorded history. She presided over fifteen different prime ministers starting with Winston Churchill.","['https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/britain-world-prepare-say-last-farewell-queen-elizabeth-2022-09-18/', 'https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2022/09/uk/queen-elizabeth-funeral-procession-intl-cmd-gbr/index.html', 'https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-62860893', 'https://apnews.com/article/queen-elizabeth-ii-health-update-b2578aa91c3fef9c5d6ad4a557bf63e4', 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-61585886', 'https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/doctors-concerned-uk-queen-elizabeths-health-2022-09-08']",queen_funeral_vector_embedding_store,"[{'queries': ['Where was Queen Elizabeth laid to rest?', 'What was the final resting place of Queen Elizabeth?', 'Where is Queen Elizabeth buried?', ""Queen Elizabeth's burial location?"", 'Where was the Queen interred after the funeral?'], 'keywords': ['Windsor Castle', ""St George's Chapel"", ""St. George's Chapel"", 'Royal Vault', 'King George VI Memorial Chapel', 'buried alongside her husband', 'buried with Prince Philip', 'private burial service', 'Windsor', 'English countryside she loved']}, {'queries': ['How did King Charles react at the funeral?', ""Did King Charles show emotion during the Queen's funeral?"", 'Emotional moments involving Charles during the ceremony?', 'What emotions did King Charles display?', ""Describe Charles's demeanor at the state funeral?""], 'keywords': ['King Charles held back tears', 'ashen faced King Charles', 'ashen-faced King Charles', 'raw emotion', 'fighting back tears', 'grief was etched on the faces of the royal family', 'strive to follow the inspiring example']}, {'queries': [""Who gave the sermon at Queen Elizabeth's funeral?"", 'Who addressed the congregation at the funeral?', ""Name the person who spoke during the Queen's service?"", 'Who delivered the eulogy at the funeral?', 'Who gave the tribute speech at Westminster Abbey?'], 'keywords': ['Justin Welby', 'archbishop of Canterbury', 'led the congregation at the state funeral', 'Dean of Westminster', 'few leaders receive the outpouring of love', 'Few leaders receive the outpouring of love', 'sermon']}, {'queries': [""Which world leaders attended Queen Elizabeth's funeral?"", ""Name some foreign dignitaries who were present at the Queen's funeral?"", 'How many presidents or prime ministers attended the service?', ""International guests at Queen Elizabeth's state funeral?"", ""Did Joe Biden attend the Queen's funeral?""], 'keywords': ['some 500 presidents, prime ministers', 'foreign royal family members', 'Joe Biden of the United States', 'dignitaries among the 2,000 congregation', '2,000 congregation', '800 guests', 'world leaders']}, {'queries': [""How did the public react to the Queen's funeral?"", 'Describe the crowds during the funeral procession?', ""Public presence and mourning at the Queen's burial?"", 'What was the reaction of people on the streets?', 'Did people throw flowers or clap during the procession?'], 'keywords': ['Huge crowds thronged the streets', 'hundreds of thousands had crammed into the capital', 'throwing flowers', 'cheering and clapping', 'lined the route as the hearse took her coffin', 'public mourning', 'crowds gathered', 'emotional spectators', 'Big Ben tolled', 'gun carriage', 'Wellington Arch', 'The Long Walk']}, {'queries': [""What symbols were removed from Queen Elizabeth's coffin?"", 'Which royal regalia was taken off the coffin?', 'What items were placed on the altar at Windsor?', ""Crown, orb, and sceptre in Queen's funeral?"", ""Describe the symbolic ritual at St George's Chapel""], 'keywords': ['the crown, orb and sceptre', 'the crown, orb and scepter', 'crown', 'orb', 'sceptre', 'scepter', ""symbols of the monarch's power"", 'removed from the coffin', 'placed on the altar', 'Wand of Office', 'Lord Chamberlain']}]","Queen Elizabeth was laid to rest alongside her beloved husband on Monday after a day which saw Britain and the world pay a final farewell to the nation's longest-reigning monarch, in a dazzling show of pomp and ceremony. Amid formality and careful choreography, there were moments of raw emotion. Late in the day an ashen-faced King Charles held back tears, while grief was etched on the faces of several members of the royal family. Huge crowds thronged the streets of London and at Windsor Castle, to witness the moving, grand processions and ceremonies. 'Few leaders receive the outpouring of love that we have seen,' Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, told the congregation at the state funeral in the majestic Westminster Abbey, where monarchs have been married, buried and crowned over the last 1,000 years. Among the 2,000 congregation were some 500 presidents, prime ministers, foreign royal family members and dignitaries, including Joe Biden of the United States. Outside hundreds of thousands, had crammed into the capital to honour Elizabeth, whose death at the age of 96 has prompted an outpouring of gratitude for her 70 years on the throne. Many more lined the route as the hearse took her coffin from London to Windsor, throwing flowers, cheering and clapping as it passed from the city to the English countryside that she loved so much. At St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle, some 800 guests attended a more intimate committal service which concluded with the crown, orb and sceptre - symbols of the monarch's power and governance - being removed from the coffin and placed on the altar. The Lord Chamberlain, the most senior official in the royal household, then broke his 'Wand of Office', signifying the end of his service to the sovereign, and placed it on the casket which then slowly descended into the royal vault. As the congregation sang 'God Save the King', King Charles who faces a huge challenge to maintain the appeal of the monarchy as economic hardship looms in Britain, appeared to be fighting back tears. It was in the same vast building that the queen was photographed alone, mourning her husband of 73 years, Prince Philip, during the pandemic lockdown, reinforcing the sense of a monarch in synch with her people during testing times. Later on Monday evening, in a private family service, the coffins of Elizabeth and Philip, who died last year aged 99, were moved from the vault to be buried together in the same chapel where her father, King George VI, mother, and sister, Princess Margaret, also rest. At the state funeral, Welby told those present that the grief felt by so many across Britain and the wider world reflected the late monarch's 'abundant life and loving service'.'Her late majesty famously declared on a 21st birthday broadcast that her whole life would be dedicated to serving the nation and Commonwealth. Rarely has such a promise been so well kept' Welby said. Music that played at the queen's wedding in 1947 and her coronation six years later again rang out. The coffin entered to lines of scripture set to a score used at every state funeral since the early 18th century. After the funeral, her flag-draped casket was pulled by sailors through London's streets on a gun carriage in one of the largest military processions seen in Britain, involving thousands of members of the armed forces dressed in ceremonial finery. They walked in step to funeral music from marching bands, while in the background the city's famous Big Ben tolled each minute. Charles and other senior royals followed on foot. The casket was taken from Westminster Abbey to Wellington Arch and transferred to a hearse to travel to Windsor, where more big crowds waited patiently. Some wore smart black suits and dresses. Others were dressed in hoodies, leggings and tracksuits. A woman with dyed green hair stood next to a man in morning suit as they waited for the London procession to begin. Millions more watched on television at home on a public holiday declared for the occasion, the first time the funeral of a British monarch has been televised.'I've been coming to Windsor for 50 years now,' said Baldev Bhakar, 72, a jeweller from the nearby town of Slough, speaking outside Windsor Castle. 'I saw her many times over the years; it felt like she was our neighbour and she was just a lovely woman; a beautiful queen. It was good to say one last goodbye to our neighbour. Queen Elizabeth died on Sept. 8 at Balmoral Castle, her summer home in the Scottish highlands. Her health had been in decline, and for months the monarch who had carried out hundreds of official engagements well into her 90s had withdrawn from public life. However, in line with her sense of duty she was photographed just two days before she died, looking frail but smiling and holding a walking stick as she appointed Liz Truss as her 15th and final prime minister. Such was her longevity and her inextricable link with Britain that even her own family found her passing a shock.'We all thought she was invincible,' Prince William told well-wishers. The 40th sovereign in a line that traces its lineage back to 1066, Elizabeth came to the throne in 1952 and became Britain's first post-imperial monarch. She oversaw her nation trying to carve out a new place in the world, and she was instrumental in the emergence of the Commonwealth of Nations, now a grouping comprising 56 countries. When she succeeded her father George VI, Winston Churchill was her first prime minister and Josef Stalin led the Soviet Union. She met major figures from politics, entertainment and sport including Nelson Mandela, Pope John Paul II, the Beatles, Marilyn Monroe, Pele and Roger Federer. Despite being reputedly 5ft 3ins (1.6m) tall, she dominated rooms with her presence and became a towering global figure, praised in death from Paris and Washington to Moscow and Beijing. National mourning was observed in Brazil, Jordan and Cuba, countries with which she had little direct link. 'People of loving service are rare in any walk of life,' Welby said during the funeral.'Leaders of loving service are still rarer. But in all cases, those who serve will be loved and remembered when those who cling to power and privileges are long forgotten.'The tenor bell of the Abbey tolled 96 times. Among the hymns chosen for the service were 'The Lord's my Shepherd', sung at her wedding in the Abbey. In the royal group following the casket into the Abbey was the queen's great-grandson and future king, Prince George, aged 9 and his younger sister Charlotte, 7. Towards the end of the service, the church and much of the nation fell silent , for two minutes. Trumpets rang out before the congregation sang 'God Save the King'. Outside, crowds joined in and broke into applause when the anthem was over. The queen's piper brought the service to an end with a lament called 'Sleep, Dearie, Sleep'. At Windsor there was a similar, poignant end to the ceremony with a lone piper walking away, leaving the chapel in silence.'I've sang God Save the Queen all my life,' said John Ellis, 56, an army veteran who had travelled to Windsor. 'It's going to be quite hard to change now.'/nQueen Elizabeth II 1926–2022 The final journey London to Windsor, follow the route to the Queen's resting place The Queen will be laid to rest at St. George's Chapel, Windsor. Pomp and pageantry will be on display as tens of thousands line the streets of the British capital and hundreds of millions tune in for the state funeral of Elizabeth II. Monday's ceremonial events are the culmination of nearly two weeks of public arrangements, codenamed 'Operation London Bridge,' honoring Elizabeth's remarkable life -- from a young princess who was not born to be Queen, to a sovereign who redefined the role and won almost universal admiration. Following the Queen's death at Balmoral on September 8, her coffin was flown back from Scotland and moved to London's Westminster Hall in a somber procession. She will lie in state there until the morning of her funeral. Crowds of mourners will flood the capital in the hopes of witnessing the coffin -- draped in the Royal Standard and carrying the Instruments of State -- one last time before the Queen makes the journey to her final resting place within St. George's Chapel in Windsor. Here's everything you need to know about Britain's farewell to one its greatest ever monarchs. Monday, September 19The day of the funeral and the final journey to Windsor Westminster HallAt around 10:35 a.m. (5:35 a.m. ET), the coffin will be lifted from the catafalque. A bearer party founded by the Queen's Company, 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards will carry it from Westminster Hall to the State Gun Carriage of the Royal Navy. The gun carriage will set off at 10:44 a.m. (5:44 a.m. ET) on the short journey from New Palace Yard to Westminster Abbey, where the funeral service will take place. The route will be lined by the Royal Navy and Royal Marines. King Charles III and members of the royal family will walk behind the coffin. Westminster AbbeyThe service will be conducted by the Dean of Westminster, starting at 11 a.m. (6 a.m. ET). The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will deliver a sermon. Towards the end of the service, at around 11:55 a.m., the Last Post will sound before a two-minute silence is observed. World leaders, politicians, public figures and European royals, as well as more than 500 dignitaries from around the world, will be at the service, which will be attended by up to 2,000 people. Following the roughly one-hour service, the coffin will be conveyed from Westminster Abbey to Wellington Arch -- again with the King leading some of the family on foot, while Camilla, the Queen Consort and others follow by car. Whitehall The route -- lined by the Armed Forces -- will pass Parliament Square and go onto Whitehall, the street that cuts through London's government district. It will pass the Cenotaph, the site of the annual National Service of Remembrance, which the Queen personally attended most years, and Downing Street. The procession moves through Horse Guards Parade, the setting for the annual Trooping the Colour ceremony held to mark the monarch's official birthday. Here, the King's Life Guard will turn out and give a royal salute as the coffin passes. The MallOn The Mall, the royal procession will pass by royal residences Clarence House and St James's Palace. Click below for a 360 view of The Mall Buckingham Palace As the coffin moves past Queen Victoria Memorial for the last time, the King's Guard will turn out in the forecourt and give a royal salute. The procession is expected at Wellington Arch around 1 p.m. (8 a.m. ET), where the bearer party will transfer it from the State Gun Carriage to the state hearse for the journey to Windsor. WindsorThe Queen's coffin will be driven to Windsor, around 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of the capital. Windsor Castle is where the Queen lived for the last two years of her life. The Long WalkOnce in Windsor, the state hearse will be driven just after 3 p.m. (10 a.m. ET) along The Long Walk, a picturesque avenue leading to the castle where thousands will be waiting to bid the Queen farewell as she passes. Windsor CastleThe King and other royals will join the procession on foot as it passes through the castle's quadrangle at around 3:40 p.m. (10:40 a.m. ET). Minute guns will be fired by the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery from the East Lawn throughout the royal cortege. The Queen's coffin will be greeted by an honor guard founded by the 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards mounted in Horseshoe Cloister at the foot of the West Steps of St. George's Chapel. Soldiers from the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment will line the steps as the bearer party carries the coffin inside for the committal service. A more intimate committal service will take place at St. George's Chapel at about 4 p.m. (11 a.m. ET), conducted by the Dean of Windsor. The royal family will gather there along with a congregation made up of members of the Royal Household, past and present, as well as personal staff who have worked on the private estates. St. George's should be a familiar location to many as it is where Prince Philip's funeral service was held last April, as well as more jubilant occasions like the nuptials of the Queen's grandchildren. At the service's conclusion, the Queen's coffin will be lowered into the Royal Vault, set below the chapel, where many royal family members have been laid to rest. The service concludes the public arrangements for the late monarch, however, a private burial service will be held for the family later Monday evening. The Queen is to be buried with her late husband of 73 years, Prince Philip, in the King George VI Memorial Chapel, located elsewhere within St. George's. The memorial chapel is where the Queen's father and mother were interred. A casket containing the ashes of the Queen's sister, Princess Margaret, is also there. Charles praises Queen's reign as he is formally confirmed as king. King Charles III described the Queen's death as an 'irreparable loss'King Charles III has praised the Queen's 'unequalled reign' after being proclaimed king at a ceremony at St James's Palace. The King became the monarch after the death of his mother, but a meeting formally confirmed it on Saturday. He also approved the day of the Queen's funeral, Monday, 19 September, being a bank holiday. Speaking before the Accession Council, the King said his mother's death had been an 'irreparable loss'. Meanwhile, senior MPs in the House of Commons, including Prime Minister Liz Truss, swore allegiance to the new monarch. Making his address in the State Apartments of St James's Palace in London, King Charles said: 'It is the greatest consolation to me to know of the sympathy expressed by so many to my sister and brothers and that such overwhelming affection and support should be extended to our whole family in our loss. 'He later spoke of the Queen's 'selfless service', saying: 'My mother's reign was unequalled in its duration, its dedication and its devotion. PA Media King Charles gave his speech in the Throne Room at St James's Palace.'Even as we grieve, we give thanks for this most faithful life. 'The King added he would 'strive to follow the inspiring example' he was set by his mother in taking on the 'heavy responsibilities of sovereignty'. It is the first time the historic ceremony, which dates back centuries, has been televised. Watch: Charles III is proclaimed King, in a ceremony broadcast for the first time. The King himself was not present for the first part of the meeting when he was proclaimed monarch by the Accession Council, made up of senior politicians, judges, and officials. Six former prime ministers were in attendance at the accession ceremony. Clerk of the Privy Council Richard Tilbrook proclaimed Charles 'King, head of the Commonwealth, defender of the faith', before declaring 'God Save the King'. The packed room, including all of the six living former British prime ministers, repeated the phrase. The proclamation was then read out on a balcony above Friary Court in St James's Palace. The new King paid warm tribute to his mother, but this was the point when Charles began to look forward to his own reign. Before the Accession Council's ranks of senior politicians and public figures, King Charles dedicated the rest of his life to serving as monarch. It was a mix of ritual, ornate language and constitutional practicality. Charles is now the head of state and here was the seamless and symbolic transfer from one reign to the next, with oaths and signatures. The inkpot used had been given to him by his sons, Prince William and Prince Harry. The announcements also confirmed that the day of the Queen's state funeral would be a public holiday. But here was the King publicly shouldering his new responsibilities, promising to follow in the Queen's example. It was the choreography of continuity. Reuters The King greeted crowds as he arrived at Buckingham Palace from the ceremonyJust before the ceremony inside, hundreds of people were allowed through from the Mall, into the palace's outdoor Friary Court, to witness the proclamation up on the balcony. They brought their babies and children and carried bunches of flowers. Some brought their dogs on a walk, diverted to witness the moment. After the state trumpeters played a fanfare, the privy councillors who had left the ceremony and gathered outside raised their voices to say 'God Save the King'. Cheers of 'hip-hip hooray' were heard coming from people lining the roads both sides of the palace, and ceremonial guns fired close to nearby Green Park. As senior figures from politics past and present filed away, senior Labour MP Harriet Harman described the ceremony inside as 'solemn', both because of the death of the Queen and the weight of the occasion for the new King. The Accession Proclamation was made on a balcony at St James's PalaceThe second reading of the Accession Proclamation was also met with applause and cheers outside the Royal Exchange in London on Saturday. On Saturday afternoon senior MPs took the oath or affirmed in the House of Commons. PA Media Three of the Queen's children and their families read tributes to the Queen as they returned from a church service. Taking her oath, the prime minister said: 'I swear by almighty God that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty King Charles, his heirs and successors, according to law, so help me God. 'On Saturday afternoon, three of the Queen's children and their families viewed flowers and tributes left outside Balmoral after attending a prayer service at Crathie Kirk, near to the castle. On their return to Balmoral they stopped their cars by the gates as they thanked well-wishers for coming to read the messages left for the Queen.

She was 96. The palace announced she died at Balmoral Castle, her summer residence in Scotland, where members of the royal family had rushed to her side after her health took a turn for the worse. A link to the almost-vanished generation that fought World War II, she was the only monarch most Britons have ever known. Her 73-year-old son Prince Charles automatically became king and will be known as King Charles III, it was announced. British monarchs in the past have selected new names upon taking the throne. Charles' second wife, Camilla, will be known as the Queen Consort. A funeral was to be held after 10 days of official mourning. The BBC played the national anthem, 'God Save the Queen,' over a portrait of Elizabeth in full regalia as her death was announced, and the flag over Buckingham Palace was lowered to half-staff as the second Elizabethan age came to a close. The impact of her loss will be huge and unpredictable, both for the nation and for the monarchy, an institution she helped stabilize and modernize across decades of enormous social change and family scandals, but whose relevance in the 21st century has often been called into question. The public's abiding affection for the queen has helped sustain support for the monarchy during the scandals. Charles is nowhere near as popular. In a statement, Charles called his mother's death 'a moment of the greatest sadness for me and all members of my family,' adding: 'I know her loss will be deeply felt throughout the country, the Realms and the Commonwealth, and by countless people around the world.'The changing of the guard comes at a fraught moment for Britain, which has a brand-new prime minister and is grappling with an energy crisis, double-digit inflation, the war in Ukraine and the fallout from Brexit. Prime Minister Liz Truss, appointed by the queen just 48 hours earlier, pronounced the country 'devastated' and called Elizabeth 'the rock on which modern Britain was built.'British subjects outside Buckingham Palace wept when officials carried a notice confirming the queen's death to the wrought-iron gates of the queen's London home. Hundreds soon gathered in the rain, and mourners laid dozens of colorful bouquets at the gates.'As a young person, this is a really huge moment,' said Romy McCarthy, 20. 'It marks the end of an era, particularly as a woman. We had a woman who was in power as someone to look up to.'World leaders extended condolences and paid tribute to the queen. In Canada, where the British monarch is the country's head of state, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's eyes were red with emotion as he saluted her 'wisdom, compassion and warmth.' In India, once the 'jewel in the crown' of the British empire, Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted: 'She personified dignity and decency in public life. Pained by her demise.'U. S. President Joe Biden called her a 'stateswoman of unmatched dignity and constancy who deepened the bedrock alliance between the United Kingdom and the United States.'Since Feb. 6, 1952, Elizabeth reigned over a Britain that rebuilt from a destructive and financially exhausting war and lost its empire; joined the European Union and then left it; and made the painful transition into the 21st century. She endured through 15 prime ministers, from Winston Churchill to Truss, becoming an institution and an icon -- a reassuring presence even for those who ignored or loathed the monarchy. She became less visible in her final years as age and frailty curtailed many public appearances. But she remained firmly in control of the monarchy and at the center of national life as Britain celebrated her Platinum Jubilee with days of parties and pageants in June. That same month she became the second longest-reigning monarch in history, behind 17th-century French King Louis XIV, who took the throne at age 4. On Tuesday, she presided at a ceremony at Balmoral Castle to accept the resignation of Boris Johnson as prime minister and appoint Truss as his successor. When Elizabeth was 21, almost five years before she became queen, she promised the people of Britain and the Commonwealth that 'my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service.'It was a promise she kept across more than seven decades. Despite Britain's complex and often fraught ties with its former colonies, Elizabeth was widely respected and remained head of state of more than a dozen countries, from Canada to Tuvalu. She headed the 54-nation Commonwealth, built around Britain and its former colonies. Married for more than 73 years to Prince Philip, who died in 2021 at age 99, Elizabeth was matriarch to a royal family whose troubles were a subject of global fascination -- amplified by fictionalized accounts such as the TV series 'The Crown.' She is survived by four children, eight grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren. Through countless public events, she probably met more people than anyone in history. Her image, which adorned stamps, coins and banknotes, was among the most reproduced in the world. But her inner life and opinions remained mostly an enigma. Of her personality, the public saw relatively little. A horse owner, she rarely seemed happier than during the Royal Ascot racing week. She never tired of the companionship of her beloved Welsh corgi dogs. Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor was born in London on April 21, 1926, the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York. She was not born to be queen -- her father's elder brother, Prince Edward, was destined for the crown, to be followed by any children he had. But in 1936, when she was 10, Edward VIII abdicated to marry twice-divorced American Wallis Simpson, and Elizabeth's father became King George VI. Princess Margaret recalled asking her sister whether this meant that Elizabeth would one day be queen. 'Yes, I suppose it does,' Margaret quoted Elizabeth as saying.'She didn't mention it again.'Elizabeth was barely in her teens when Britain went to war with Germany in 1939. While the king and queen stayed at Buckingham Palace during the Blitz and toured the bombed-out neighborhoods of London, Elizabeth and Margaret spent most of the war at Windsor Castle, west of the capital. Even there, 300 bombs fell in an adjacent park, and the princesses spent many nights in an underground shelter. She made her first public broadcast in 1940 when she was 14, sending a wartime message to children evacuated to the countryside or overseas.'We children at home are full of cheerfulness and courage,' she said with a blend of stoicism and hope that would echo throughout her reign. 'We are trying to do all we can to help out gallant soldiers, sailors and airmen. And we are trying, too, to bear our own share of the danger and sadness of war. We know, every one of us, that in the end all will be well.'In 1945, after months of campaigning for her parents' permission to do something for the war effort, the heir to the throne became Second Subaltern Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. She enthusiastically learned to drive and service heavy vehicles. On the night the war ended in Europe, May 8, 1945, she and Margaret managed to mingle, unrecognized, with celebrating crowds in London — 'swept along on a tide of happiness and relief,' as she told the BBC decades later, describing it as 'one of the most memorable nights of my life.'At Westminster Abbey in November 1947 she married Royal Navy officer Philip Mountbatten, a prince of Greece and Denmark whom she had first met in 1939 when she was 13 and he 18. Postwar Britain was experiencing austerity and rationing, and so street decorations were limited and no public holiday was declared. But the bride was allowed 100 extra ration coupons for her trousseau. The couple lived for a time in Malta, where Philip was stationed, and Elizabeth enjoyed an almost-normal life as a navy wife. The first of their four children, Prince Charles, was born in 1948. He was followed by Princess Anne in 1950, Prince Andrew in 1960, and Prince Edward in 1964. In 1952, George VI died at 56 after years of ill health. Elizabeth, on a visit to Kenya, was told that she was now queen. Her private secretary, Martin Charteris, later recalled finding the new monarch at her desk, 'sitting erect, no tears, color up a little, fully accepting her destiny.''In a way, I didn't have an apprenticeship,' Elizabeth reflected in a BBC documentary in 1992 that opened a rare view into her emotions.'My father died much too young, and so it was all a very sudden kind of taking on, and making the best job you can.'Her coronation took place more than a year later, a grand spectacle at Westminster Abbey viewed by millions through the still-new medium of television. Prime Minister Winston Churchill's first reaction to the king's death was to complain that the new queen was 'only a child,' but he was won over within days and eventually became an ardent admirer. In Britain's constitutional monarchy, the queen is head of state but has little direct power; in her official actions she does what the government orders. However, she was not without influence. The queen, officially the head of the Church of England, once reportedly commented that there was nothing she could do legally to block the appointment of a bishop, 'but I can always say that I should like more information. That is an indication that the prime minister will not miss.'The extent of the monarch's political influence occasionally sparked speculation -- but not much criticism while Elizabeth was alive. The views of Charles, who has expressed strong opinions on everything from architecture to the environment, might prove more contentious. She was obliged to meet weekly with the prime minister, and they generally found her well-informed, inquisitive and up to date. The one possible exception was Margaret Thatcher, with whom her relations were said to be cool, if not frosty, though neither woman ever commented. The queen's views in those private meetings became a subject of intense speculation and fertile ground for dramatists like Peter Morgan, author of the play 'The Audience' and the hit TV series 'The Crown.' Those semi-fictionalized accounts were the product of an era of declining deference and rising celebrity, when the royal family's troubles became public property. And there were plenty of troubles within the family, an institution known as 'The Firm.' In Elizabeth's first years on the throne, Princess Margaret provoked a national controversy through her romance with a divorced man. In what the queen called the 'annus horribilis' of 1992, her daughter, Princess Anne, was divorced, Prince Charles and Princess Diana separated, and so did her son Prince Andrew and his wife, Sarah. That was also the year Windsor Castle, a residence she far preferred to Buckingham Palace, was seriously damaged by fire. The public split of Charles and Diana -- 'There were three of us in that marriage,' Diana said of her husband's relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles -- was followed by the shock of Diana's death in a Paris car crash in 1997. For once, the queen appeared out of step with her people. Amid unprecedented public mourning, Elizabeth's failure to make a public show of grief appeared to many to be unfeeling. After several days, she finally made a televised address to the nation. The dent in her popularity was brief. She was by now a sort of national grandmother, with a stern gaze and a twinkling smile. Despite being one of the world's wealthiest people, Elizabeth had a reputation for frugality and common sense. She turned off lights in empty rooms, and didn't flinch from strangling pheasants. A newspaper reporter who went undercover to work as a palace footman reinforced that down-to-earth image, capturing pictures of the royal Tupperware on the breakfast table and a rubber duck in the bath. Her sangfroid was not dented when a young man aimed a pistol at her and fired six blanks as she rode by on a horse in 1981, nor when she discovered a disturbed intruder sitting on her bed in Buckingham Palace in 1982. The image of the queen as an exemplar of ordinary British decency was satirized by the magazine Private Eye, which called her Brenda, apparently because it sounded working-class. Anti-monarchists dubbed her 'Mrs. Windsor.' But the republican cause gained limited traction while the queen was alive. On her Golden Jubilee in 2002, she said the country could 'look back with measured pride on the history of the last 50 years.''It has been a pretty remarkable 50 years by any standards,' she said in a speech. 'There have been ups and downs, but anyone who can remember what things were like after those six long years of war appreciates what immense changes have been achieved since then.'A reassuring presence at home, she was also an emblem of Britain abroad — a form of soft power, consistently respected whatever the vagaries of the country's political leaders on the world stage. It felt only fitting that she attended the opening of the 2012 London Olympics alongside another icon, James Bond. Through some movie magic, she appeared to parachute into the Olympic Stadium. In 2015, she overtook her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria's reign of 63 years, seven months and two days to become the longest-serving monarch in British history. She kept working into her 10th decade, though Prince Charles and his elder son, Prince William, increasingly took over the visits, ribbon-cuttings and investitures that form the bulk of royal duties. The loss of Philip in 2021 was a heavy blow, as she poignantly sat alone at his funeral in the chapel at Windsor Castle because of coronavirus restrictions. And the family troubles continued. Her son Prince Andrew was entangled in the sordid tale of sex offender businessman Jeffrey Epstein, an American businessman who had been a friend. Andrew denied accusations that he had sex with one of the women who said she was trafficked by Epstein. The queen's grandson Prince Harry walked away from Britain and his royal duties after marrying American TV actress Meghan Markle, who is biracial, in 2018. He alleged in an interview that some in the family -– but pointedly not the queen -– had been less than welcoming to his wife. She enjoyed robust health well into her 90s, although she used a cane in an appearance after Philip's death. Months ago, she told guests at a reception 'as you can see, I can't move.' The palace, tight-lipped about details, said the queen was experiencing 'episodic mobility issues.'She held virtual meetings with diplomats and politicians from Windsor Castle, but public appearances grew rarer. Meanwhile, she took steps to prepare for the transition to come. In February, the queen announced that she wanted Camilla to be known as 'Queen Consort' when 'in the fullness of time' her son became king. It removed a question mark over the role of the woman some blamed for the breakup of Charles' marriage to Princess Diana in the 1990s. May brought another symbolic moment, when she asked Charles to stand in for her and read the Queen's Speech at the State Opening of Parliament, one of the monarch's most central constitutional duties. Seven decades after World War II, Elizabeth was again at the center of the national mood amid the uncertainty and loss of COVID 19 -- a disease she came through herself in February. In April 2020 -- with the country in lockdown and Prime Minister Boris Johnson hospitalized with the virus -- she made a rare video address, urging people to stick together. She summoned the spirit of World War II, that vital time in her life, and the nation's, by echoing Vera Lynn's wartime anthem 'We'll Meet Again.''We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return. We will be with our friends again. We will be with our families again. We will meet again,' she said. Queen Elizabeth II, the UK's longest-serving monarch, has died at Balmoral aged 96, after reigning for 70 years. She died peacefully on Thursday afternoon at her Scottish estate, where she had spent much of the summer. The Queen came to the throne in 1952 and witnessed enormous social change. Her son King Charles III said the death of his beloved mother was a 'moment of great sadness' for him and his family and that her loss would be 'deeply felt' around the world. He said: 'We mourn profoundly the passing of a cherished sovereign and a much-loved mother. 'I know her loss will be deeply felt throughout the country, the realms and the Commonwealth, and by countless people around the world.'During the coming period of mourning, he said he and his family would be 'comforted and sustained by our knowledge of the respect and deep affection in which the Queen was so widely held'. The King and his wife, Camilla, now Queen Consort, will return to London on Friday, Buckingham Palace said. He is expected to address the nation. Senior royals had gathered at Balmoral after the Queen's doctors became concerned about her health earlier in the day. All the Queen's children travelled to Balmoral, near Aberdeen, after doctors placed the Queen under medical supervision. Her grandson and now heir to the throne, Prince William, and his brother, Prince Harry, also gathered there. Queen Elizabeth, Britain's longest-reigning monarch, the nation's figurehead and a towering presence on the world stage for seven decades, died peacefully at her home in Scotland on Thursday aged 96.'The death of my beloved Mother, Her Majesty The Queen, is a moment of the greatest sadness for me and all members of my family,' the new king, her eldest son Charles, said. 'I know her loss will be deeply felt throughout the country, the Realms and the Commonwealth, and by countless people around the world,' the 73-year-old said in a statement. News that the queen's health was deteriorating emerged shortly after midday on Thursday when her doctors said she was under medical supervision, prompting her family to rush to Balmoral Castle in Scotland to be by her side. Thousands gathered outside Buckingham Palace, in central London, and there was a stunned silence when the flag was lowered to half-mast. The crowd surged to the gates as the notice announcing the death of the only monarch most Britons have ever known was attached to the black iron gates. Royal officials said King Charles III and his wife Camilla, the Queen Consort, would remain at Balmoral before returning to London on Friday, when Charles is expected to address the nation and meet Prime Minister Liz Truss. Details of the funeral have not been confirmed. On Elizabeth's death, Charles automatically became monarch, opens new tab of the United Kingdom and the head of state of 14 other realms including Australia, Canada and New Zealand. The queen, whose husband died last year, had been suffering from what Buckingham Palace had called 'episodic mobility problems' since the end of last year, forcing her to withdraw from nearly all her public engagements. Her last official duty came only on Tuesday, when she appointed Truss prime minister - the 15th of her reign.'The death of Her Majesty the Queen is a huge shock to the nation and to the world,' Truss said outside her Downing Street office where the flag, like those at royal palaces and government buildings across Britain, were lowered. 'Through thick and thin, Queen Elizabeth II provided us with the stability and the strength that we needed. She was the very spirit of Great Britain – and that spirit will endure,' said Truss, who was informed of the death at 4:30 p.m. London time. The news stunned not only people in Britain, with condolences pouring in from leaders around the world. 'Her legacy will loom large in the pages of British history, and in the story of our world,' U. S. President Joe Biden said in a statement. He ordered flags at the White House to be flown at half-mastIn Paris, the mayor announced the lights of the Eiffel Tower would be turned off in honour of her passing; in Brazil, the Christ the Redeemer statue was illuminated with the colours of the Union Jack and the government declared three days of mourning; and the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council both stood for a moment of silence. Even Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose country's relations with Britain have plummeted over the war in Ukraine, extended his condolences, calling it an 'irreparable loss'. Queen Elizabeth II, who was also the world's oldest and longest-serving head of state, came to the throne, opens new tab following the death of her father King George VI on Feb. 6, 1952, when she was just 25. She was crowned in June the following year, opens new tab. The first televised coronation was a foretaste of a new world in which the lives of the royals were to become increasingly scrutinised by the media. 'I have in sincerity pledged myself to your service, as so many of you are pledged to mine. Throughout all my life and with all my heart I shall strive to be worthy of your trust,' she said in a speech to her subjects on her coronation day. Despite reputedly only being about 5ft 3ins tall, she commanded any room she entered. Famed for her bright outfits, she is said to have quipped: 'I have to be seen to be believed'. Elizabeth became monarch at a time when Britain still retained much of its old empire. It was emerging from the ravages of World War Two, with food rationing still in force and class and privilege still dominant in society. Winston Churchill was Britain's prime minister at the time, Josef Stalin led the Soviet Union and the Korean War was raging. In the decades that followed, Elizabeth witnessed massive political change and social upheaval at home and abroad. Her own family's tribulations, most notably the divorce of Charles and his late first wife Diana, were played out in full public glare. While remaining an enduring symbol of stability and continuity for Britons at a time of relative national economic decline, Elizabeth also tried to adapt the ancient institution of monarchy to the demands of the modern era.'She has managed to modernise and evolve the monarchy like no other,' her grandson Prince William, who is now heir to the throne, said in a 2012 documentary. Elizabeth was the 40th monarch in a royal line that followed Norman King William the Conqueror, who claimed the English throne in 1066 after defeating Anglo-Saxon ruler Harold II at the Battle of Hastings. Her long reign meant she repeatedly broke records for British rulers. When she surpassed the more than 63 years her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria spent on the throne, she said it was not a landmark to which she had ever aspired. 'Inevitably a long life can pass by many milestones - my own is no exception,' she said. Her marriage to Prince Philip lasted 73 years, until his death in April 2021, and they had four children, Charles, Anne, Andrew and Edward. She never gave a media interview and critics said she came across as distant and aloof. But for the vast majority of her subjects she was a figure who commanded respect and admiration. Her death marks the end of an era. 'When people around the world spoke of 'the queen', they actually meant our queen,' former Prime Minister John Major said.'That was the status she had in every part of the world. It was truly remarkable.'At her death the queen was head of state of not only the United Kingdom but also of Australia, the Bahamas, Belize, Canada, Grenada, Jamaica, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Saint Lucia, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Tuvalu, the Solomon Islands, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Antigua and Barbuda. Opinion polls have suggested that Charles does not enjoy anywhere near the same level of support and there is speculation the loss of Elizabeth may see a rise in republican sentiment, particularly in the other realms. In some former colonies in the Caribbean, pressure has been rising to remove the monarch as their head of state and for Britain to pay reparations for its involvement in the historical slave trade. read more'As the role of the monarchy changes, we expect this can be an opportunity to advance discussions of reparations for our region,' said Niambi Hall-Campbell, a 44-year-old academic who chairs the Bahamas National Reparations Committee. Asked in a radio interview if the Queen's death took Australia closer to being a republic, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said it was not the time to talk about it.",662,Long,7462,"[{'version':

The ceremony, attended by hundreds of dignitaries and thousands of mourners, marked the end of a week-long period of national mourning. The day began with the Queen's coffin being carried from Westminster Hall to the State Gun Carriage of the Royal Navy, followed by a procession through the streets of London. The route was lined with members of the armed forces, and the crowds that gathered to pay their respects were estimated to number in the hundreds of thousands. At Westminster Abbey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, delivered a sermon that paid tribute to the Queen's ""abundant life and loving service."" The service was attended by more than 2,000 guests, including 500 heads of state and government, and the congregation sang hymns that had been played at the Queen's wedding and coronation. Following the service, the Queen's coffin was taken to Wellington Arch and then to Windsor Castle, where a smaller, more intimate committal service was held at St. George's Chapel. The service concluded with the removal of the crown, orb, and sceptre from the coffin and their placement on the altar, and the breaking of the Lord Chamberlain's Wand of Office, signifying the end of his service to the sovereign. King Charles III, who faces a significant challenge in maintaining the appeal of the monarchy in the face of economic hardship, appeared to be fighting back tears as the congregation sang ""God Save the King."" The service was broadcast live on television, and millions of people across the UK and around the world watched the proceedings. Later in the evening, the Queen's coffin and that of her husband, Prince Philip, who died last year, were moved to the royal vault in St. George's Chapel, where they were buried together. The Queen's father, King George VI, mother, and sister, Princess Margaret, also rest in the same chapel. The state funeral was a fitting tribute to a monarch who was revered by her subjects and admired by people around the world. The Queen's reign spanned seven decades, and she oversaw her nation's transition from an empire to a Commonwealth. She was instrumental in the emergence of the Commonwealth of Nations, now a grouping of 56 countries. The Queen's death on September 8 at Balmoral Castle, her summer home in the Scottish Highlands, was a shock to her family and the nation. Despite her advanced age and declining health, her death was unexpected, and her passing marked the end of an era. The Queen's funeral was a poignant and moving ceremony that brought the nation together in grief and celebration of a life well lived. The Queen's coffin was carried through the streets of London by sailors in a procession that was one of the largest military processions seen in Britain in recent years. The crowds that lined the route were a testament to the Queen's enduring popularity and the love and respect that she inspired in her subjects. ","Queen Elizabeth II, the United Kingdom's longest-reigning monarch, was laid to rest on Monday following a solemn state funeral attended by tens of thousands of mourners and millions of television viewers. The ceremony marked the culmination of two weeks of public arrangements, codenamed 'Operation London Bridge,' honoring the queen's remarkable 70-year reign. The funeral procession began in London, where the queen's coffin, draped in the Royal Standard and carrying the Instruments of State, made its final journey to St. George's Chapel in Windsor. The route was lined with crowds of mourners who threw flowers, cheered, and clapped as the hearse passed from the city to the English countryside that the queen loved so much. At St. George's Chapel, a more intimate committal service was held, attended by around 800 guests. The service concluded with the crown, orb, and sceptre - symbols of the monarch's power and governance - being removed from the coffin and placed on the altar. The queen's coffin was then lowered into the Royal Vault, set below the chapel, where many royal family members have been laid to rest. Following the queen's death at Balmoral on September 8, her coffin was flown back from Scotland and moved to London's Westminster Hall in a somber procession. She lay in state there until the morning of her funeral. The memorial chapel, where the queen's father and mother were interred, is also the final resting place of a casket containing the ashes of her sister, Princess Margaret. The queen's death at the age of 96 has prompted an outpouring of gratitude for her 70-year reign. Her grandson and now heir to the throne, Prince William, and his brother, Prince Harry, were among those who gathered at Balmoral to pay their respects. The impact of her loss will be huge and unpredictable, both for the nation and for the monarchy, an institution she helped stabilize and modernize across decades of enormous social change and family scandals.

Had the latest acquisition offer gone through, it would have been the largest deal since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, and one of the biggest ever among companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.A deal would likely mean integrating the GSK division into Unilever's own beauty and personal care business, which has seen profit margins struggle under Covid-19 lockdowns and higher costs for plastics and petrochemicals.A brief response on the Unilever website confirmed it 'had approached GSK and Pfizer about a potential acquisition, and adds GSK Consumer Healthcare 'would be a strong strategic fit' as the company looks to rework its portfolio. GSK indicated the proposals were 'carefully evaluated' by its board of directors, but unanimously rejected under the conclusion they 'were not in the best interests of GSK shareholders' and 'failed to reflect the intrinsic value of the business and its potential'.The Sunday Times have indicated the latest deal did not include an acquisition premium or recognition of corporate synergies; the joint venture between GSK and healthcare firm Pfizer, which holds a minority stake in the company, was initially projected to generate GBP500 million in cost savings by this year and realise 'substantial cost synergies'. The BBC's business editor Simon Jack wrote that a standard takeover premium would be about 30%, but could be reduced over the GBP10 billion in debt GSK was predicted to 'leave on the books', of the GBP22 billion net debt GSK reported for Q3 2021.The deals were assessed by the Board respective of a proposed demerger of GSK Consumer Health into a separate PLC in the middle of this year. Jack wrote GSK 'always' had 'an open mind to a trade sale to another party if the price was right.' Unilever did not take into account the standard takeover premium, the value of cost savings and Board confidence Consumer Health could deliver 'superior organic sales growth' of between four and six per cent in the medium term. This was despite valuations of about GBP50 billion by Goldman Sachs and Barclays analysts, and a lower GBP45 billion valuation by Jeffries Group.There are no current talks between Unilever and either Pfizer or GSK, and the Unilever statement reads: 'There can be no certainty that any agreement will be reached.' Under CEO Alan Jope, Unilever has focused its investments and marketing on brands which 'communicate a strong environmental or social purpose' by streamlining its holdings in items like beauty products and tea. Jope previously said Unilever would concentrate on smaller takeovers in industries like luxury beauty and wellness.However, Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, told the BBC this would be a 'high risk deal' at a time investors are cautious about GSK's performance, but also a time of rising inflation he says encourages 'consumer goods with loyal customers'. Mould added despite strong cashflow, Unilever had recently missed targets on sales and profit margins, putting pressure on the CEO.Pressure by activist shareholders Elliott Management Corporation and Bluebell Capital Partners have also mounted against GSK CEO Emma Walmsley over the unit's failure to develop a Covid-19 vaccine and Walmsley's own lack of scientific experience. GSK has been involved in the ongoing development of a Covid-19 vaccine with French biopharmaceutical company Sanofi, and announced preliminary results from Phase 3 trials last month.In 2018, Unilever bought several consumer nutritional products from GSK, including its flagship product Horlicks, and merged its Indian subsidiary, Hindustan Unilever, with GSK Consumer Healthcare

businesses into a new world-leading Joint Venture, with combined sales of approximately £9.8 billion ($12.7 billion). GSK will have a majority controlling equity interest of 68% and Pfizer will have an equity interest of 32% in the Joint Venture. The proposed all-equity transaction represents a compelling opportunity to build on the recent buyout of Novartis' stake in GSK Consumer Healthcare, to create a new world-leading consumer healthcare business and to deliver further significant shareholder value. The proposed transaction also supports GSK's key priority of strengthening its pharmaceuticals business over the next few years by increasing cashflows and providing an effective pathway through the separation of GSK Consumer Healthcare to build further support for investment in its R&D pipeline. New Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture: The new Joint Venture will be well-positioned to deliver stronger sales, cash flow and earnings growth driven by category leading Power Brands, science-based innovation and substantial cost synergies. The combination will bring together two highly complementary portfolios of trusted consumer health brands, including GSK's Sensodyne, Voltaren and Panadol and Pfizer's Advil, Centrum and Caltrate. The Joint Venture will be a category leader in Pain Relief, Respiratory, Vitamin and Mineral Supplements, Digestive Health, Skin Health and Therapeutic Oral Health. The Joint Venture will be the global leader in OTC products with a market share of 7.3% ahead of its nearest competitor at 4.1% and have number 1 or 2 market share positions in all key geographies, including the US and China. The proposed transaction is expected to realise substantial cost synergies, with the Joint Venture expected to generate total annual cost savings of £0.5 billion by 2022 for expected total cash costs of £0.9 billion and non-cash charges of £0.3 billion. Planned divestments targeting around £1 billion of net proceeds are expected to cover the cash costs of the integration. Up to 25% of the cost savings are intended to be reinvested in the business to support innovation and other growth opportunities. Overall the Joint Venture will target an Adjusted operating margin percentage in the 'mid-to-high 20s' by 2022. GSK expects the proposed transaction to be accretive to Total earnings in the second full year following closing, reflecting the impact and timing for the costs of integration; and to be accretive to Adjusted earnings and free cashflow in the first full year after closingFuture separation: The proposed transaction is transformational to the scale of GSK's Consumer Healthcare business. Within 3 years of the closing of the transaction, GSK intends to separate the Joint Venture via a demerger of its equity interest and a listing of GSK Consumer Healthcare on the UK equity market. Over this period, GSK will substantially complete the integration and expects to make continued progress in strengthening its Pharmaceuticals business and R&D pipeline. The intended separation of the Group will allow the two resulting companies to be established with appropriate capital structures for their future investment needs and capital allocation priorities. The new consumer healthcare company with its more durable cash flows will be able to support higher leverage levels than the GSK Group today, creating the opportunity on separation to reduce the leverage in the new Pharmaceuticals/Vaccines company. Dividend expectations: GSK remains committed to its current dividend policy and confirms it continues to expect to pay 80 pence per share in dividends for 2018. Recognising the significance of this proposed transaction and the importance of dividends to shareholders, the company is today confirming that it expects to pay dividends of 80 pence per share for 2019. Going forward, the proposed transaction enhances prospects for the Consumer Healthcare business and supports the development of GSK's Pharmaceuticals business. With expected improvements in both businesses, GSK expects to be well positioned to deliver returns to shareholders alongside continued investment in its strategic priorities. Emma Walmsley, Chief Executive Officer, GSK, said 'Eighteen months ago, I set out clear priorities and a capital allocation framework for GSK to improve our long-term competitive performance and to strengthen our ability to bring new breakthrough medicines and better healthcare products to people around the world. We have improved our operating performance and have set out a new approach to R&D. We have also started to reshape the Group's portfolio through prioritisation of R&D programmes, acquisitions such as that proposed with the oncology biopharmaceutical company, TESARO, the minority buy-out of the consumer healthcare business and a series of non-core product divestments.'The transaction we have announced today is a unique opportunity to accelerate this work. Through the combination of GSK and Pfizer's consumer healthcare businesses we will create substantial further value for shareholders. At the same time, incremental cashflows and visibility of the intended separation will help support GSK's future capital planning and further investment in our pharmaceuticals pipeline.'With our future intention to separate, the transaction also presents a clear pathway forward for GSK to create a new global Pharmaceuticals/Vaccines company, with an R&D approach focused on science related to the immune system, use of genetics and advanced technologies, and a new world-leading Consumer Healthcare company.'Ultimately, our goal is to create two exceptional, UK-based global companies, with appropriate capital structures, that are each well positioned to deliver improving returns to shareholders and significant benefits to patients and consumers.'New Joint Venture: GSK and Pfizer have today entered into an agreement under which, upon closing of the proposed transaction, Pfizer will contribute its consumer healthcare business to GSK's existing consumer healthcare business in return for equity shares in this business. As a result, a new Joint Venture will be created in which GSK will have a controlling 68% equity interest and Pfizer a 32% equity interest. GSK and Pfizer have provided customary and broadly reciprocal representations, warranties and indemnities to each other in respect of their respective businesses that will be included in the Joint Venture, which are subject to customary limitations of liability. Combined 2017 global sales for the Joint Venture were approximately £9.8 billion ($12.7 billion)[2]. The Joint Venture will be a category leader in Pain Relief, Respiratory, Vitamin and Mineral Supplements, Digestive Health, OTC Skin Health and Therapeutic Oral Health and will have the largest global market share in OTC at 7.3% ahead of its nearest competitor at 4.1%. The Joint Venture is expected to have number 1 or 2 market share positions in all key geographies, including the US, Western, Central and Eastern Europe, China, India and Australasia. The Joint Venture will operate under the GSK Consumer Healthcare name in all territories where GSK and Pfizer have a presence, with the exception of GSK's interest in its listed subsidiary in Nigeria which will be excluded from the Joint Venture. The assets within the scope of, and the proceeds of, GSK's proposed divestment of Horlicks and other Consumer Healthcare nutrition products to Unilever will not be included in the Joint Venture. Until separation, the Joint Venture will be consolidated in GSK's financial statements and is not expected to carry any external debt. Governance and leadership: The Joint Venture will be subject to a shareholders' agreement between GSK and Pfizer, under which GSK will have 6 directors and Pfizer 3 directors on the board of the joint venture company. GSK will have control of the joint venture company through the board, while Pfizer will enjoy customary minority shareholder protections. Emma Walmsley will be Chair of the new Joint Venture until separation. Brian McNamara, currently CEO GSK Consumer Healthcare, will be CEO of the new Joint Venture and Tobias Hestler, currently CFO GSK Consumer Healthcare will be CFO. Separation rights: As stated above the proposed transaction is transformational to the scale of GSK's consumer healthcare business and following substantial completion of the integration and further progress in strengthening the pharmaceuticals pipeline, GSK intends to separate the Joint Venture from GSK via a demerger of its equity interest to GSK shareholders and a listing of the GSK Consumer Healthcare business on the UK equity market. This is expected to be within 3 years of the closing of the transaction. GSK will have the sole right to decide whether and when to initiate a separation and listing for a period of five years from closing of the proposed transaction. GSK has also retained the right to sell all or part of its stake in the Joint Venture in a contemporaneous IPO. In the event of the separation and listing occurring in this period, Pfizer has the option to participate through the demerger of its equity interest in the Joint Venture to its shareholders or the sale of its equity interest in a contemporaneous IPO. After the fifth anniversary of closing of the proposed transaction, both GSK and Pfizer will have the right to decide whether and when to initiate a separation and listing of the Joint Venture. In circumstances where Pfizer initiates a separation and listing of the Joint Venture after the fifth anniversary of closing of the proposed transaction, GSK will have the right to acquire all (but not part) of Pfizer's equity interest in the Joint Venture at fair market value. In addition, from the fifteenth anniversary of closing of the proposed transaction, GSK will have the right to acquire all (but not part) of Pfizer's equity interest in the Joint Venture at fair market value. As a part of any separation and listing, the Joint Venture will incur borrowings so as to result in an initial ratio of net debt to the aggregate of the Joint Venture's last four quarters' Adjusted EBITDA of between 3.5x and 4.0x. The cash proceeds of this recapitalisation will be distributed by the Joint Venture to GSK and Pfizer in proportion to their respective interests in the Joint Venture prior to any separation and listing. In the event of any separation and listing, GSK also has the right to determine the Joint Venture's prospective dividend policy provided the pay-out ratio is between 30% and 50% of the aggregate of the Joint Venture's last four quarters' Adjusted profit attributable to shareholders. Conditions to closing: Pfizer is treated as a related party of GSK for the purposes of the UK Listing Rules by virtue of its interest in ViiV Healthcare and, as such, the proposed transaction is conditional upon the approval of GSK's shareholders at a general meeting. GSK has agreed that its Board will recommend that shareholders vote in favour of the resolution approving the Proposed Transaction, subject to provisions that allow the recommendation to be withdrawn on account of fiduciary duties. The proposed transaction is also conditional on there being no governmental orders restraining or prohibiting the transaction and certain anti-trust authority approvals. Expected timetable to closing: A circular setting out further details on the proposed transaction, including the resolution seeking shareholder approval, will be sent to GSK shareholders in the first quarter of 2019. Closing of the proposed transaction is currently expected to occur during the second half of 2019, subject to shareholder approval and relevant anti-trust approvals. Break fee: GSK has agreed to pay a break fee of US$900 million if (i) the Board changes, withdraws or qualifies its recommendation; (ii) shareholders vote on the proposed transaction and do not approve it; or (iii) shareholders do not approve the proposed transaction by 30 September 2019 (or, at either GSK's or Pfizer's option, 31 December 2019 or 31 March 2020 in the case of delayed anti-trust approvals). By virtue of Pfizer being a related party of GSK under the UK Listing Rules, the break fee constitutes a smaller related party transaction within LR11.1.10R of the UK Listing Rules. GSK has obtained written confirmation from Citi and J. P. Morgan Cazenove that the terms of the break fee are fair and reasonable so far as GSK's shareholders are concerned. Advisors: GSK has been advised by Citi, who has been acting as lead advisor, J. P. Morgan Cazenove and Greenhill & Co. Slaughter and May and Kirkland & Ellis LLP have provided legal advice. Advice to the Board: The Board, which has been so advised by Citi and J. P. Morgan Cazenove, considers the terms of the proposed transaction to be fair and reasonable so far as shareholders are concerned. In providing their advice to the Board, Citi and J. P. Morgan Cazenove have taken into account the Board's commercial assessment of the proposed transaction. Information on GSK's consumer healthcare business: As at 31 December 2017, the value of the gross assets of GSK's consumer healthcare business to be contributed to the new Joint Venture was £16,071 million. In the financial year ended 31 December 2017, that business had sales of £7,110 million, Adjusted operating profit of £1,254 million, Total operating profit of £891 million and Total profit before tax of £884 million. GlaxoSmithKline has rejected three Unilever offers to buy its consumer goods division, including one worth £50bn. GSK said the proposals 'fundamentally failed' to reflect the value of the division. With a successful bid, Unilever - which owns Marmite, Dove and PG Tips - would add Sensodyne toothpaste and Panadol to its list of household brands. Such a deal would be one of the biggest ever involving London-listed firms. GSK said in a statement the most recent proposal from Unilever on 20 December contained an offer for £41.7bn in cash and £8.3bn in Unilever shares. The global healthcare company, which has its headquarters in London, has already been preparing to separate its consumer goods division from its pharmaceutical business in the middle of this year. The firm has come under pressure from investors for failing to develop a Covid vaccine. Unilever said in a statement the GSK consumer arm 'would be a strong strategic fit as Unilever continues to reshape its portfolio'. The consumer goods giant, which became a fully British company in 2020 after previously being separated between the UK and the Netherlands, also approached Pfizer about the potential deal, since the American pharmaceutical giant owns a 34% stake in GSK's consumer goods business. Neither GSK nor Pfizer has any ideological objection to selling to Unilever. GSK had planned to spin off its consumer business later this year anyway through a demerger creating a separate publicly listed company but always said it would have an open mind to a trade sale to another party if the price was right. GSK's problem with the Unilever bid is that the price isn't right. Both Barclays and Goldman Sachs analysts have valued the business at around £50bn. However, that does not include a few important things. First, the premium you would normally expect to pay for taking control of a business - somewhere in the range of 30% - although that might be reduced by the debt of about £10bn GSK was expected to leave on the books of the consumer business. Second, the value of the cost savings GSK admits could be made to make the business more profitable. Third, it may not reflect the higher sales growth targets GSK boss Emma Walmsley has said are possible for the business. She has also said the benefit of a demerger is current GSK shareholders would get shares in the demerged business so retain their participation in any future growth in the consumer business. Some will say if higher growth and greater cost reductions are possible, why haven't they happened already? Emma Walmsley has been in charge for more than four years. That's one of the questions activist shareholder Elliot Management has implicitly asked by encouraging other shareholders to agitate for a more radical greater break up of one of the UK's most valuable companies. The BBC understands the very different ideas on what this business is worth means there are no active and ongoing discussions between GSK and Unilever. But Unilever's intentions are very clear. The 'for sale' sign is now very visible and the elbows will get sharper as this basket of household consumer goods gets closer to the checkout. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said Unilever's chief executive Alan Jope was under pressure because the business had recently missed targets for sales and profit margins.'Unilever has strong cashflow, but the heat is on Mr Jope. He wants to be seen to do something,' Mr Mould said.'But this is a high risk deal. Many investors see GSK as underperforming. But at a time when inflation is rising, consumer goods with loyal customers represent a good way for firms to try to manage profits.'GSK said its consumer goods division had the potential to increase sales by up to 6% a year in the medium term, and Unilever's offers did not take that into account. It said the proposals were not in the best interests of GSK shareholders. Preliminary figures show sales for GSK's consumer division reached £9.6bn in 2021. Other brands in the division include Centrum vitamins, Aquafresh toothpaste and Nicorette gum. The company has said it is in late stage trails of a Covid vaccine it was developing with the French pharmaceutical firm, Sanofi. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK. L), opens new tab on Saturday said it had rejected a 50-billion-pound offer from Unilever (ULVR. L), opens new tab for its consumer goods arm, saying it 'fundamentally undervalued' the business and its future prospects and that it would stick to its plan of spinning off the unit. Unilever confirmed the approach earlier on Saturday, saying the Glaxo unit would be a 'strong strategic fit' as it continues to re-shape its portfolio spanning food, beauty and home care brands. The Reuters Tariff Watch newsletter is your daily guide to the latest global trade and tariff news. Sign up here. A deal of this size would be the biggest globally since the start of the pandemic, if it goes through. It could also transform Unilever into a formidable beauty and personal care purveyor, taking on the likes of Estee Lauder and L'Oreal, while for GSK, it could bring much needed relief from investor pressure that has been building over the past year. GSK said it had received three bids from Unilever, the latest on Dec. 20 comprising 41.7 billion pounds in cash and 8.3 billion pounds in Unilever shares, which failed to reflect the intrinsic value of the business and its potential. 'The Board of GSK therefore remains focused on executing its proposed demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business ... on track to be achieved in mid-2022,' the statement said, adding that it was confident the business would beat global market growth rates in the medium term. The group's consumer goods business is due to be spun out into a separate listing in the middle of this year. Earlier, Britain's Sunday Times said the Unilever bid for the business made late last year was worth roughly 50 billion pounds, and had been rejected as too low by GSK and Pfizer, opens new tab, which owns a minority stake in the division. The approach by Unilever, which owns brands such as Dove soap and Marmite, for Glaxo's portfolio of household brands including Panadol painkillers and Sensodyne toothpaste was understood to have been unsolicited, the report added. The bid did not include any takeover premium or recognition of synergies, the newspaper said, adding that it was not clear whether the group would make a higher offer. Dave Lewis, who is due to head GSK's consumer health unit, declined to comment on the approach. The former boss of UK grocer Tesco, opens new tab said the matter was for GSK's board. Unilever declined to comment on whether it would return with a higher bid. 'There can be no certainty that any agreement will be reached.' Brokerage Jefferies last year put a valuation for the whole consumer unit at 45 billion pounds. If a deal goes through, GSK's consumer health unit's brands would likely be incorporated into Unilever's Beauty and Personal Care business, its biggest by sales. Performance in the unit, which sells Dove, Lifebuoy, Axe and Vaseline, has been tepid during the pandemic as fewer people venture out or attend social occasions, while higher costs of plastics and petrochemicals have also dented margins. In its most recent quarter, Beauty and Personal care volumes fell 1.3% while prices rose 3.9%. Unilever's Chief Executive Alan Jope is under pressure to turn around its languishing stock price as it struggles to compete in the face of high inflationary costs, especially in emerging markets, its biggest source of revenue. The FTSE-listed conglomerate's stock has fallen 10% over the past year compared with P&G's 18% rise and Reckitt's 1.4% decline, despite a pandemic-driven boost in shopping for groceries and household goods that has benefited all three companies. British fund manager Terry Smith, whose Fundsmith vehicle is a top-10 Unilever investor, this week criticized the group for promoting sustainability credentials at the expense of performance. Since taking over from Paul Polman as CEO in 2019, Jope has laid out a vision for Unilever called 'brands with purpose', a socially conscious strategy that would see the company focus investments and marketing on brands that 'communicate a strong environmental or social purpose' even at the cost of profit.'A company which feels it has to define the purpose of Hellmann's mayonnaise has in our view clearly lost the plot. The Hellmann's brand has existed since 1913 so we would guess that by now consumers have figured out its purpose (spoiler alert — salads and sandwiches),' Smith said. Smith was not immediately available to comment. Jope, however, has kept to his promise of streamlining the company. The company sold a majority of its Tea business, including Pukka Tea and PGTips to CVC Capital partners for $5 billion late last year and has been looking to offload a portfolio of slow growing beauty brands. Investor activism has also reared its head at GSK. In April last year, U. S. activist hedge fund Elliott Management revealed a multi-billion pound stake in GSK, putting pressure on CEO Emma Walmsley to explore a shake-up of the company after it fell behind in the COVID-19 vaccine race. Fledgling activist investor Bluebell Capital Partners, fresh off its success in ousting the CEO of Danone last year, also took a stake in GSK in September, making demands including asking Walmsley to re-apply for her job, citing a lack of scientific expertise. For Unilever, the deal would be the biggest move for Jope since becoming CEO in 2019. He has previously shot down suggestions that Unilever was in the market for big deals, saying instead that the company would focus on smaller acquisitions in fast-growing areas such as luxury beauty, plant-based foods and health and wellness. If a deal with GSK does go through, it will be Unilever's second with the company after it bought its health food drinks business, including Horlicks, in India and other Asian markets for 3.3 billion euros in 2018. The consumer remedies industry, which has traditionally been attached to the prescription drug sector, is also in a phase of major transformation as several pharma companies no longer see a benefit in a combination.",676,Long,3937,"[{'version': 'Human', 'Compression Ratio': 0.1712938711}, {'version': 'LLM_Plain', 'Compression Ratio': 0.11629125200000001}, {'version': 'LLM_RAG', 'Compression Ratio':

In a statement released on Tuesday, GSK said that it had received three separate bids from Unilever to purchase its consumer healthcare business, but that it had rejected all of them. The British pharmaceutical company said that it believed the offers did not reflect the true value of the business. GSK's consumer healthcare arm, which includes brands such as Sensodyne, Voltaren, and Panadol, reported sales of approximately £9.8 billion ($12.7 billion) in 2017. The business is expected to be a category leader in Pain Relief, Respiratory, Vitamin and Mineral Supplements, Digestive Health, OTC Skin Health, and Therapeutic Oral Health, with the largest global market share in OTC at 7.3%. The rejection of Unilever's bids comes as GSK has entered into an agreement with Pfizer to combine their consumer health businesses into a new world-leading joint venture. Under the terms of the agreement, GSK will have a majority controlling equity interest of 68% and Pfizer will have an equity interest of 32% in the joint venture. The proposed all-equity transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2019. GSK's consumer healthcare business is expected to generate total annual cost savings of £0.5 billion by 2022 for expected total cash costs of £0.9 billion and non-cash charges of £0.3 billion. The joint venture is expected to be accretive to GSK's earnings in the second full year following closing, reflecting the impact and timing for the costs of integration. Emma Walmsley, Chief Executive Officer of GSK, said in a statement, ""We have improved our operating performance and have set out a new approach to R&D. We have also started to reshape the Group's portfolio through prioritisation of R&D programmes, acquisitions such as that proposed with the oncology biopharmaceutical company, TESARO, the minority buy-out of the consumer healthcare business and a series of non-core product divestments."" Walmsley added, ""The transaction we have announced today is a unique opportunity to accelerate this work. Through the combination of GSK and Pfizer's consumer healthcare businesses we will create substantial further value for shareholders. At the same time, incremental cashflows and visibility of the intended separation will help support GSK's future capital planning and further investment in our pharmaceuticals pipeline."" GSK remains committed to its current dividend policy and confirms it continues to expect to pay 80 pence per share in dividends for 2018. Recognising the significance of this proposed transaction and the importance of dividends to shareholders, the company is today confirming that it expects to pay dividends of 80 pence per share for 2019. ","GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has rejected three bids from Unilever to buy its consumer goods division, including one worth £50bn. The British multinational pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and consumer goods company said the proposals 'fundamentally failed' to reflect the value of the division. In a statement, GSK said the most recent proposal from Unilever on 20 December contained an offer for £41.7bn in cash and £8.3bn in Unilever shares. The global healthcare company, which has its headquarters in London, has already been preparing to separate its consumer goods division from its pharmaceutical business in the middle of this year. GSK's consumer goods division, which includes household brands such as Panadol painkillers and Sensodyne toothpaste, has the potential to increase sales by up to 6% a year in the medium term, according to the company. However, Unilever's offers did not take this potential growth into account, GSK said. The consumer goods giant, which became a fully British company in 2020 after previously being separated between the UK and the Netherlands, also approached Pfizer about the potential deal, since the American pharmaceutical giant owns a 34% stake in GSK's consumer goods business. If a deal goes through, GSK's consumer health unit's brands would likely be incorporated into Unilever's Beauty and Personal Care business, its biggest by sales. Performance in the unit, which sells Dove, Lifebuoy, Axe and Vaseline, has been tepid during the pandemic as fewer people venture out or attend social occasions, while higher costs of plastics and petrochemicals have also dented margins. A deal of this size would be the biggest globally since the start of the pandemic, if it goes through. It could also transform Unilever into a formidable beauty and personal care purveyor, taking on the likes of Estee Lauder and L'Oreal, while for GSK, it could bring much needed relief from investor pressure that has been building over the past year. GSK said it had received three bids from Unilever, the latest on Dec. 20 comprising 41.7 billion pounds in cash and 8.3 billion pounds in Unilever shares, which failed to reflect the intrinsic value of the business and its potential. 'The Board of GSK therefore remains focused on executing its proposed demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business ... on track to be achieved in mid-2022,' the statement said, adding that it was confident the business would beat global market growth rates in the medium term.
